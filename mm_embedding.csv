0," Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors?",PRELUDE.,8.606354,2.2993019,68
1,"Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve.",PRELUDE.,8.869586,2.465925,40
2,That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning.,PRELUDE.,9.96656,2.2059052,6
3,"Theresa’s passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her?",PRELUDE.,9.500031,2.1334724,24
4,"Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self.",PRELUDE.,9.750497,1.3992393,36
5,She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.,PRELUDE.,10.434351,1.3676121,11
6,"That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not the last of her kind.",PRELUDE.,9.992274,2.1977715,17
7,"Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion.",PRELUDE.,9.122194,2.3919299,54
8,"With dim lights and tangled circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul.",PRELUDE.,9.271618,2.2069542,55
9,"Their ardor alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.",PRELUDE.,9.832963,2.0548563,28
10,"Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with scientific certitude.",PRELUDE.,9.932674,2.5045865,54
11,"Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite love-stories in prose and verse.",PRELUDE.,9.644985,2.3731837,32
12,"Here and there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind.",PRELUDE.,7.963249,3.4602027,28
13,"Here and there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed.",PRELUDE.,9.122304,2.1123357,34

16,Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress.,CHAPTER I.,6.8016763,-1.5069399,17
17,"Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper.",CHAPTER I.,9.765976,1.0595455,78
18,"She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense.",CHAPTER I.,10.276883,-1.59844,20
19,"Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her sister shared.",CHAPTER I.,10.014755,-1.4895589,46
20,"The pride of being ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family estate.",CHAPTER I.,7.159059,-1.5445142,81
21,"Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s daughter.",CHAPTER I.,10.101159,2.3656886,30
22,"Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank.",CHAPTER I.,7.07649,4.4855394,31
23,"Such reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation.",CHAPTER I.,10.156718,-1.5923836,53
24,"Dorothea knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam.",CHAPTER I.,8.624528,-3.023004,37
25,"She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery.",CHAPTER I.,10.223685,1.116203,24
26,"Her mind was theoretic, and yearned by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it.",CHAPTER I.,10.404342,1.2962327,73
27,"Certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection.",CHAPTER I.,10.067411,2.0639815,33
28,"With all this, she, the elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their orphaned condition.",CHAPTER I.,10.634616,2.1349068,68
29,"It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous opinions, and uncertain vote.",CHAPTER I.,6.9496217,-0.35259077,29
30,"He had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind.",CHAPTER I.,7.4480762,2.5335376,25
31,"Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as possible in carrying them out.",CHAPTER I.,6.51154,-1.1265435,38
32,"For the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.",CHAPTER I.,8.391992,2.9686055,40
33,"In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his way of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of money for generous schemes.",CHAPTER I.,7.816567,-2.0693312,68
34,"She was regarded as an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of genteel life.",CHAPTER I.,7.9235024,-2.1906457,76
35,And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such prospects?,CHAPTER I.,8.562532,-3.0812044,13
36,"Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers.",CHAPTER I.,10.767151,1.9461404,43
37,"A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old theological books!",CHAPTER I.,10.09947,2.440301,57
38,Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such fellowship.,CHAPTER I.,10.062395,2.8800561,43
39,"Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on.",CHAPTER I.,10.057835,2.5081189,24
40,"Sane people did what their neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid them.",CHAPTER I.,8.748577,3.8197885,21
41,"The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers, was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her religion, too unusual and striking.",CHAPTER I.,7.1684012,-1.5731112,37
42,Poor Dorothea!,CHAPTER I.,8.799828,-3.70288,2
43,"compared with her, the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of blazonry or clock-face for it.",CHAPTER I.,10.281804,-1.5218498,31
44,"Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with it.",CHAPTER I.,8.550399,-3.5456016,23
45,Most men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback.,CHAPTER I.,9.865309,0.924831,10
46,"She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee.",CHAPTER I.,9.652291,1.1063929,29
47,"Riding was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to renouncing it.",CHAPTER I.,9.841213,1.0266485,31
48,"She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for Celia to accept him.",CHAPTER I.,9.834547,-1.5203769,86
49,That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance.,CHAPTER I.,10.946246,1.8593181,18
50,"Dorothea, with all her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about marriage.",CHAPTER I.,8.55884,-3.3489363,17
51,"She felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover?",CHAPTER I.,10.56456,1.8189648,79
52,"The really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.",CHAPTER I.,9.966588,2.8805003,25
53,These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces.,CHAPTER I.,7.9116497,-2.0757952,30
54,"But he himself dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire.",CHAPTER I.,8.798704,-1.6264371,64
55,"So Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.",CHAPTER I.,7.1757693,-1.3332855,24
56,"Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt some venerating expectation.",CHAPTER I.,8.339942,-1.8657037,28
57,"This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon, noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication of his book.",CHAPTER I.,7.88998,-0.073619865,62
58,His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.,CHAPTER I.,7.5802426,2.8924477,16
59,"Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to propose something, said—  “Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them?",CHAPTER I.,8.907687,-2.8088744,87
60,"It is exactly six months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at them yet.”  Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious electricity if you touched them incautiously.",CHAPTER I.,10.051405,-1.7302158,62
61,"To her relief, Dorothea’s eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.",CHAPTER I.,9.194861,-3.0485184,13
62,"“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia!",CHAPTER I.,10.207989,-1.4942727,8
63,"Is it six calendar or six lunar months?”  “It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April when uncle gave them to you.",CHAPTER I.,10.050912,3.348145,29
64,"You know, he said that he had forgotten them till then.",CHAPTER I.,7.4286633,2.5271983,11
65,"I believe you have never thought of them since you locked them up in the cabinet here.”  “Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory.",CHAPTER I.,9.242054,-2.9376354,37
66,"She had her pencil in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.",CHAPTER I.,9.777459,1.0402001,15
67,"Celia colored, and looked very grave.",CHAPTER I.,10.232467,-1.5497969,6
68,"“I think, dear, we are wanting in respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.",CHAPTER I.,11.234708,3.229985,21
69,"And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.",CHAPTER I.,9.824666,-2.0233786,35
70,And Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really applied herself to argument.,CHAPTER I.,10.1942,-1.6177393,26
71,"“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments.",CHAPTER I.,9.466379,-2.6171606,34
72,"“Of course, then, let us have them out.",CHAPTER I.,9.563355,5.232275,8
73,Why did you not tell me before?,CHAPTER I.,8.968975,5.415996,7
74,"But the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her head and seemed to despair of her memory.",CHAPTER I.,9.571941,1.3540648,22
75,"“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long meditated and prearranged.",CHAPTER I.,10.275367,-1.6183631,15
76,"“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”  The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread out, making a bright parterre on the table.",CHAPTER I.,9.189622,1.0483459,33
77,"It was no great collection, but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.",CHAPTER I.,8.610792,0.82230324,43
78,"Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.",CHAPTER I.,9.374629,-2.4210794,45
79,"“There, Celia!",CHAPTER I.,10.215282,-1.4699734,2
80,you can wear that with your Indian muslin.,CHAPTER I.,9.753528,0.14837688,8
81,But this cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”  Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure.,CHAPTER I.,10.143482,-1.6761824,18
82,"“O Dodo, you must keep the cross yourself.”  “No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless deprecation.",CHAPTER I.,9.3209715,-3.170802,21
83,"“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,” said Celia, insistingly.",CHAPTER I.,10.047135,-1.7241168,15
84,"“You might wear that.”  “Not for the world, not for the world.",CHAPTER I.,10.02888,-1.7428228,12
85,A cross is the last thing I would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.,CHAPTER I.,9.393283,-2.7792625,15
86,"“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.",CHAPTER I.,10.081107,-1.7301635,14
87,"“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek.",CHAPTER I.,9.293427,-3.2629685,9
88,"“Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”  “But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”  “No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so fond of—plenty of things.",CHAPTER I.,11.09916,3.1535897,39
89,"In fact, they are all yours, dear.",CHAPTER I.,8.483348,4.9536266,7
90,We need discuss them no longer.,CHAPTER I.,9.141377,4.207354,6
91,There—take away your property.”  Celia felt a little hurt.,CHAPTER I.,10.267327,-1.6222566,9
92,"There was a strong assumption of superiority in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.",CHAPTER I.,10.219221,1.1813643,26
93,"“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear them?”  “Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to keep you in countenance.",CHAPTER I.,10.0011425,-1.7718122,35
94,"If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I should feel as if I had been pirouetting.",CHAPTER I.,9.927192,-1.8682795,20
95,"The world would go round with me, and I should not know how to walk.”  Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off.",CHAPTER I.,10.097038,-1.7887981,24
96,"“It would be a little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit you better,” she said, with some satisfaction.",CHAPTER I.,10.552749,3.380842,24
97,"The complete unfitness of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia happier in taking it.",CHAPTER I.,9.380288,-2.303367,19
98,"She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.",CHAPTER I.,9.279168,1.0049908,28
99,"“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current of feeling, as sudden as the gleam.",CHAPTER I.,9.265886,-2.8967977,19
100,"“It is strange how deeply colors seem to penetrate one, like scent.",CHAPTER I.,9.709266,2.7122798,12
101,I suppose that is the reason why gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John.,CHAPTER I.,8.497298,1.0356047,19
102,They look like fragments of heaven.,CHAPTER I.,8.710755,1.580088,6
103,"I think that emerald is more beautiful than any of them.”  “And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia.",CHAPTER I.,9.536585,-2.0847127,21
104,"“We did not notice this at first.”  “They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on a level with her eyes.",CHAPTER I.,9.501057,-2.4450634,36
105,All the while her thought was trying to justify her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.,CHAPTER I.,10.152821,1.207054,22
106,"“You would like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly, beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness, and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than purple amethysts.",CHAPTER I.,8.967111,-2.3943748,34
107,“You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing else.,CHAPTER I.,9.839712,-1.938735,9
108,"But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”  “Yes!",CHAPTER I.,9.649175,4.4089646,10
109,"I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER I.,9.557074,-2.3990953,9
110,"Then, letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what miserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She paused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.",CHAPTER I.,10.1323,-1.6416816,48
111,"“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly.",CHAPTER I.,9.387455,-3.1931653,9
112,"“But take all the rest away, and the casket.”  She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking at them.",CHAPTER I.,9.295084,1.142218,23
113,"She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at these little fountains of pure color.",CHAPTER I.,9.766671,1.1171129,19
114,"“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with real curiosity as to what she would do.",CHAPTER I.,10.132304,-1.6587653,21
115,Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister.,CHAPTER I.,9.131335,-3.1122065,6
116,"Across all her imaginative adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen discernment, which was not without a scorching quality.",CHAPTER I.,10.285446,1.145234,25
117,"If Miss Brooke ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward fire.",CHAPTER I.,6.741809,-1.5363387,16
118,"“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily.",CHAPTER I.,10.405713,3.8438814,5
119,"“I cannot tell to what level I may sink.”  Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away.",CHAPTER I.,10.111346,-1.6304833,45

258,"If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a suitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him were already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day the reasons had budded and bloomed.",CHAPTER III.,7.246575,-1.2373471,48
259,"For they had had a long conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company of Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to play with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.",CHAPTER III.,9.814437,-1.5224847,38
260,"Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine extension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own experience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent.",CHAPTER III.,8.286301,-2.2412364,52
261,"For he had been as instructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness, justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr. Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally revealed.",CHAPTER III.,8.005692,-0.079708874,68
262,"Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of correspondences.",CHAPTER III.,9.033188,1.2483844,28
263,But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no light or speedy work.,CHAPTER III.,8.897684,1.6499617,15
264,"His notes already made a formidable range of volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf.",CHAPTER III.,8.030141,2.562532,36
265,"In explaining this to Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done to a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command: it is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the English with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in any case.",CHAPTER III.,8.300907,-2.1350207,58
266,"A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his acquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men, that conne Latyn but lytille.”  Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this conception.",CHAPTER III.,8.382173,-2.7320354,37
267,"Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who united the glories of doctor and saint.",CHAPTER III.,8.869279,0.4485769,37
268,"The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when Dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr. Casaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of his own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to her.",CHAPTER III.,8.510538,-2.7124932,117
269,"“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror.",CHAPTER III.,8.954636,-3.5648549,25
270,"And his feelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little pool!”  Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly than other young ladies of her age.",CHAPTER III.,6.806146,-1.5050681,31
271,"Signs are small measurable things, but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of knowledge.",CHAPTER III.,10.038508,1.2977399,43

275,"Mr. Casaubon was called into the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a “Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the journal of his youthful Continental travels.",CHAPTER III.,7.9858813,-0.5996346,63

281,"Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and that the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum.",CHAPTER III.,7.867992,-0.19760007,65

284,"Before he left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke along the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils of maturity.",CHAPTER III.,6.8420777,-1.4715798,51

287,"The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the 2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of that date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten writing.",CHAPTER III.,7.5261207,2.5578191,59
288,"But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in experience is an epoch.",CHAPTER III.,8.246481,-2.2174628,39
289,"It was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr. Casaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along the shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk, the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in their walks.",CHAPTER III.,8.423787,-2.3792808,75

295,"All people, young or old (that is, all people in those ante-reform times), would have thought her an interesting object if they had referred the glow in her eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary images of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all spontaneous trust ought to be.",CHAPTER III.,9.808133,1.0300238,63

298,"But perhaps no persons then living—certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton—would have had a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.",CHAPTER III.,10.025953,1.52828,73

622,"She attributed Dorothea’s abstracted manner, and the evidence of further crying since they had got home, to the temper she had been in about Sir James Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further offence: having once said what she wanted to say, Celia had no disposition to recur to disagreeable subjects.",CHAPTER V.,9.022131,-2.4867816,55

626,"Now, though they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when Celia put by her work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which she was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low stool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the musical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her speech like a fine bit of recitative—  “Celia, dear, come and kiss me,” holding her arms open as she spoke.",CHAPTER V.,9.227625,-2.442875,84

634,"Hitherto she had classed the admiration for this “ugly” and learned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at Lausanne, also ugly and learned.",CHAPTER V.,6.4533825,0.72362196,24

636,Why then should her enthusiasm not extend to Mr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret?,CHAPTER V.,8.39558,-0.43119183,19

640,Not that she now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover: she had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in Dorothea’s mind could tend towards such an issue.,CHAPTER V.,8.254439,-2.2179978,34
641,"Here was something really to vex her about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir James Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon!",CHAPTER V.,10.686706,-1.0267546,27

644,"The day was damp, and they were not going to walk out, so they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia observed that Dorothea, instead of settling down with her usual diligent interest to some occupation, simply leaned her elbow on an open book and looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with the damp.",CHAPTER V.,8.982955,-2.5718765,60

646,Dorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know of the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon’s position since he had last been in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her in ignorance of what would necessarily affect her attitude towards him; but it was impossible not to shrink from telling her.,CHAPTER V.,8.838539,-2.230811,58
647,"Dorothea accused herself of some meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her to have any small fears or contrivances about her actions, but at this moment she was seeking the highest aid possible that she might not dread the corrosiveness of Celia’s pretty carnally minded prose.",CHAPTER V.,9.035875,-2.634533,49

1049,"In the beginning of his career, Mr. Casaubon had only held the living, but the death of his brother had put him in possession of the manor also.",CHAPTER IX.,7.9695334,-0.24445601,28
1050,"It had a small park, with a fine old oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest front, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from the drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope of greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures, which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun.",CHAPTER IX.,8.76697,1.1598271,68
1051,"This was the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather melancholy even under the brightest morning.",CHAPTER IX.,8.864068,1.0056179,21
1052,"The grounds here were more confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards from the windows.",CHAPTER IX.,8.655483,1.1123668,31
1053,"The building, of greenish stone, was in the old English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows, and little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home.",CHAPTER IX.,8.972965,0.9139318,42
1054,"In this latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves falling slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without sunshine, the house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr. Casaubon, when he presented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown into relief by that background.",CHAPTER IX.,8.186974,-0.03379401,52
1055,"“Oh dear!” Celia said to herself, “I am sure Freshitt Hall would have been pleasanter than this.” She thought of the white freestone, the pillared portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling above them like a prince issuing from his enchantment in a rose-bush, with a handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from the most delicately odorous petals—Sir James, who talked so agreeably, always about things which had common-sense in them, and not about learning!",CHAPTER IX.,9.707793,-1.0409139,75
1056,"Celia had those light young feminine tastes which grave and weatherworn gentlemen sometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon’s bias had been different, for he would have had no chance with Celia.",CHAPTER IX.,9.971592,-1.514884,34
1057,"Dorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she could wish: the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and curtains with colors subdued by time, the curious old maps and bird’s-eye views on the walls of the corridor, with here and there an old vase below, had no oppression for her, and seemed more cheerful than the casts and pictures at the Grange, which her uncle had long ago brought home from his travels—they being probably among the ideas he had taken in at one time.",CHAPTER IX.,8.621432,-2.837674,91
1058,"To poor Dorothea these severe classical nudities and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully inexplicable, staring into the midst of her Puritanic conceptions: she had never been taught how she could bring them into any sort of relevance with her life.",CHAPTER IX.,8.695081,-2.8063755,39
1059,"But the owners of Lowick apparently had not been travellers, and Mr. Casaubon’s studies of the past were not carried on by means of such aids.",CHAPTER IX.,7.6313157,-0.9584371,26
1060,Dorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion.,CHAPTER IX.,8.863049,-2.9925554,8
1061,"Everything seemed hallowed to her: this was to be the home of her wifehood, and she looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew her attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she would like an alteration.",CHAPTER IX.,8.428545,-0.30928022,45
1062,"All appeals to her taste she met gratefully, but saw nothing to alter.",CHAPTER IX.,10.351003,1.3709995,13
1063,His efforts at exact courtesy and formal tenderness had no defect for her.,CHAPTER IX.,10.213551,1.9623303,13
1064,"She filled up all blanks with unmanifested perfections, interpreting him as she interpreted the works of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her own deafness to the higher harmonies.",CHAPTER IX.,10.168135,1.2049625,30
1065,And there are many blanks left in the weeks of courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.,CHAPTER IX.,9.933674,2.6929336,19
1066,"“Now, my dear Dorothea, I wish you to favor me by pointing out which room you would like to have as your boudoir,” said Mr. Casaubon, showing that his views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to include that requirement.",CHAPTER IX.,8.29007,-2.218621,41
1067,"“It is very kind of you to think of that,” said Dorothea, “but I assure you I would rather have all those matters decided for me.",CHAPTER IX.,9.16161,-3.4450283,26
1068,"I shall be much happier to take everything as it is—just as you have been used to have it, or as you will yourself choose it to be.",CHAPTER IX.,8.21389,4.9940248,28
1069,"I have no motive for wishing anything else.”  “Oh, Dodo,” said Celia, “will you not have the bow-windowed room up-stairs?”  Mr. Casaubon led the way thither.",CHAPTER IX.,8.662733,-0.41797096,26
1070,"The bow-window looked down the avenue of limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were miniatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a group.",CHAPTER IX.,9.191166,0.85258687,31
1071,A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a blue-green world with a pale stag in it.,CHAPTER IX.,9.052685,0.8477751,18
1072,The chairs and tables were thin-legged and easy to upset.,CHAPTER IX.,8.851663,1.3689711,10
1073,It was a room where one might fancy the ghost of a tight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her embroidery.,CHAPTER IX.,9.244949,0.9072841,20
1074,"A light bookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf, completing the furniture.",CHAPTER IX.,8.942282,1.0133715,14
1075,"“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, “this would be a pretty room with some new hangings, sofas, and that sort of thing.",CHAPTER IX.,6.931012,-1.0974158,20

1080,"“Perhaps this was your mother’s room when she was young.”  “It was,” he said, with his slow bend of the head.",CHAPTER IX.,10.506918,3.6602316,21
1081,"“This is your mother,” said Dorothea, who had turned to examine the group of miniatures.",CHAPTER IX.,8.986271,-3.143135,15
1082,"“It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I should think, a better portrait.",CHAPTER IX.,9.461425,2.3052819,16
1083,"And this one opposite, who is this?”  “Her elder sister.",CHAPTER IX.,10.634211,3.2414837,10
1084,"They were, like you and your sister, the only two children of their parents, who hang above them, you see.”  “The sister is pretty,” said Celia, implying that she thought less favorably of Mr. Casaubon’s mother.",CHAPTER IX.,9.792864,-1.4592534,36
1085,"It was a new opening to Celia’s imagination, that he came of a family who had all been young in their time—the ladies wearing necklaces.",CHAPTER IX.,10.148483,-1.6506064,25
1086,"“It is a peculiar face,” said Dorothea, looking closely.",CHAPTER IX.,9.123514,-3.0524528,9
1087,“Those deep gray eyes rather near together—and the delicate irregular nose with a sort of ripple in it—and all the powdered curls hanging backward.,CHAPTER IX.,8.548475,1.6297874,24
1088,Altogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty.,CHAPTER IX.,9.116318,1.8838406,9
1089,There is not even a family likeness between her and your mother.”  “No.,CHAPTER IX.,10.669299,3.3739417,13
1090,"And they were not alike in their lot.”  “You did not mention her to me,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER IX.,9.053381,-3.4194322,17
1091,“My aunt made an unfortunate marriage.,CHAPTER IX.,10.274737,3.3310032,6
1092,"I never saw her.”  Dorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just then to ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and she turned to the window to admire the view.",CHAPTER IX.,8.290459,-2.3055778,38
1093,"The sun had lately pierced the gray, and the avenue of limes cast shadows.",CHAPTER IX.,8.894437,1.0526499,14
1094,“Shall we not walk in the garden now?” said Dorothea.,CHAPTER IX.,9.253694,-3.2710338,10
1095,"“And you would like to see the church, you know,” said Mr. Brooke.",CHAPTER IX.,6.67689,-1.2684333,13

1098,It all lies in a nut-shell.,CHAPTER IX.,8.91211,5.420756,6
1099,"By the way, it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are like a row of alms-houses—little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of thing.”  “Yes, please,” said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I should like to see all that.” She had got nothing from him more graphic about the Lowick cottages than that they were “not bad.”  They were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy borders and clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church, Mr. Casaubon said.",CHAPTER IX.,8.84208,-0.71376705,84
1100,At the little gate leading into the churchyard there was a pause while Mr. Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to fetch a key.,CHAPTER IX.,8.190148,0.61386305,25
1101,"Celia, who had been hanging a little in the rear, came up presently, when she saw that Mr. Casaubon was gone away, and said in her easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict the suspicion of any malicious intent—  “Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the walks.”  “Is that astonishing, Celia?”  “There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke.",CHAPTER IX.,9.648118,-1.5961553,71
1102,"“I told Casaubon he should change his gardener.”  “No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book.",CHAPTER IX.,9.511655,-1.3992836,19
1103,He had light-brown curls.,CHAPTER IX.,8.304831,1.6834571,4
1104,I only saw his back.,CHAPTER IX.,8.753189,3.9928832,5

1107,He is going to introduce Tucker.,CHAPTER IX.,10.773844,4.986632,6
1108,"You don’t know Tucker yet.”  Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,” who are usually not wanting in sons.",CHAPTER IX.,6.867534,3.8962374,23
1109,"But after the introduction, the conversation did not lead to any question about his family, and the startling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but Celia.",CHAPTER IX.,10.143082,-1.526755,28
1110,"She inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and slim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as old and musty-looking as she would have expected Mr. Casaubon’s curate to be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven (for Celia wished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so unpleasant.",CHAPTER IX.,9.748959,-1.5250301,61
1111,"Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should have to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no pretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.",CHAPTER IX.,10.042208,-1.5107583,33
1112,"Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had not been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to answer all Dorothea’s questions about the villagers and the other parishioners.",CHAPTER IX.,8.27251,-2.1584985,35
1113,"Everybody, he assured her, was well off in Lowick: not a cottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the strips of garden at the back were well tended.",CHAPTER IX.,9.006356,-0.1949403,35
1114,"The small boys wore excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though the public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards spirituality, there was not much vice.",CHAPTER IX.,11.231176,4.0481234,44
1115,"The speckled fowls were so numerous that Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for the women to glean, I see.",CHAPTER IX.,8.6514845,1.1893456,22
1116,"The poor folks here might have a fowl in their pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his people.",CHAPTER IX.,7.063141,4.554006,23
1117,"The French eat a good many fowls—skinny fowls, you know.”  “I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly.",CHAPTER IX.,7.0931683,4.636034,23
1118,"“Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal virtue?”  “And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be nice.",CHAPTER IX.,7.086629,4.501268,30
1119,"But perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”  “Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was subauditum; that is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his head towards Celia, who immediately dropped backward a little, because she could not bear Mr. Casaubon to blink at her.",CHAPTER IX.,8.539616,-0.588045,60
1120,Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house.,CHAPTER IX.,8.735914,-3.045041,11
1121,"She felt some disappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing for her to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had glanced over the possibility, which she would have preferred, of finding that her home would be in a parish which had a larger share of the world’s misery, so that she might have had more active duties in it.",CHAPTER IX.,9.403711,0.21672386,68
1122,"Then, recurring to the future actually before her, she made a picture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims in which she would await new duties.",CHAPTER IX.,8.525589,-0.19816537,27
1123,Many such might reveal themselves to the higher knowledge gained by her in that companionship.,CHAPTER IX.,10.473103,1.8593224,15
1124,"Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not allow him to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden through the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—  “You seem a little sad, Dorothea.",CHAPTER IX.,8.248615,-2.1489375,39
1125,"I trust you are pleased with what you have seen.”  “I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered Dorothea, with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people wanted more to be done for them here.",CHAPTER IX.,9.164728,-3.4029589,38

1130,"Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any yearning unfulfilled.”  “Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly.",CHAPTER IX.,8.890049,-2.6603105,21
1131,“Do not suppose that I am sad.”  “That is well.,CHAPTER IX.,9.848454,4.5303264,10
1132,"But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to the house than that by which we came.”  Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a fine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side of the house.",CHAPTER IX.,8.912621,-3.120688,49
1133,"As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark background of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old tree.",CHAPTER IX.,8.791802,1.1553919,22
1134,"Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his head, and said—  “Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”  They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—  “That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in fact,” he added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you have been noticing, my aunt Julia.”  The young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen.",CHAPTER IX.,7.577604,-1.2209201,69
1135,"His bushy light-brown curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once with Celia’s apparition.",CHAPTER IX.,9.978133,-1.3321046,16
1136,"“Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw.",CHAPTER IX.,7.434725,-2.3432822,10
1137,"Will, this is Miss Brooke.”  The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea could see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate irregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward; but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect than belonged to the type of the grandmother’s miniature.",CHAPTER IX.,8.583217,-2.2586572,64
1138,"Young Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he were charmed with this introduction to his future second cousin and her relatives; but wore rather a pouting air of discontent.",CHAPTER IX.,5.785375,-0.039815273,33
1139,"“You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book and turning it over in his unceremonious fashion.",CHAPTER IX.,8.161472,1.2568685,21
1140,"“No, I only sketch a little.",CHAPTER IX.,8.872449,2.1921425,6

1148,"I suppose there is some relation between pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel—just as you see what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.” Dorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his head towards her, while Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly—  “Bless me, now, how different people are!",CHAPTER IX.,8.507064,1.083106,56

1152,"Ladislaw had made up his mind that she must be an unpleasant girl, since she was going to marry Casaubon, and what she said of her stupidity about pictures would have confirmed that opinion even if he had believed her.",CHAPTER IX.,5.839455,-0.022553733,40
1153,"As it was, he took her words for a covert judgment, and was certain that she thought his sketch detestable.",CHAPTER IX.,10.789649,1.776816,20
1154,There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was laughing both at her uncle and himself.,CHAPTER IX.,10.448029,2.5554142,17
1155,But what a voice!,CHAPTER IX.,9.182249,6.230231,4

1165,"I was too indolent, you know: else I might have been anywhere at one time.”  “That is a seasonable admonition,” said Mr. Casaubon; “but now we will pass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of standing.”  When their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his sketching, and as he did so his face broke into an expression of amusement which increased as he went on drawing, till at last he threw back his head and laughed aloud.",CHAPTER IX.,5.9363656,-0.070361964,87
1166,Partly it was the reception of his own artistic production that tickled him; partly the notion of his grave cousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke’s definition of the place he might have held but for the impediment of indolence.,CHAPTER IX.,6.8493695,-1.3042653,44
1167,"Mr. Will Ladislaw’s sense of the ludicrous lit up his features very agreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and had no mixture of sneering and self-exaltation.",CHAPTER IX.,5.8711653,-0.03806851,28

1687,"But let us go down.”  Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long enough to see him; for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him, and she herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of his—“Flow on, thou shining river”—after she had sung “Home, sweet home” (which she detested).",CHAPTER XII.,5.627315,1.2489997,58

1690,"His dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged patient—who can hardly believe that medicine would not “set him up” if the doctor were only clever enough—added to his general disbelief in Middlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision of Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to introduce as his niece, though he had never thought it worth while to speak of Mary Garth in that light.",CHAPTER XII.,6.510948,0.9993041,73
1691,"Nothing escaped Lydgate in Rosamond’s graceful behavior: how delicately she waived the notice which the old man’s want of taste had thrust upon her by a quiet gravity, not showing her dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing them afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she addressed herself with so much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining Mary more fully than he had done before, saw an adorable kindness in Rosamond’s eyes.",CHAPTER XII.,5.5766816,1.1710547,74

2051,"The evidence of his cleverness was of the higher intuitive order, lying in his lady-patients’ immovable conviction, and was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in Wrench and “the strengthening treatment” regarding Toller and “the lowering system” as medical perdition.",CHAPTER XV.,6.1978736,2.8979232,54

2068,"He was a vigorous animal with a ready understanding, but no spark had yet kindled in him an intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him a very superficial affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of his elders, he had apparently got already more than was necessary for mature life.",CHAPTER XV.,7.887059,2.5210853,49

2077,"A liberal education had of course left him free to read the indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his internal structure, had left his imagination quite unbiassed, so that for anything he knew his brains lay in small bags at his temples, and he had no more thought of representing to himself how his blood circulated than how paper served instead of gold.",CHAPTER XV.,7.7248096,2.5790727,75

2085,"The story of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by the gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.",CHAPTER XV.,8.904765,2.2747476,65

2088,"Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the better hope of him because his scientific interest soon took the form of a professional enthusiasm: he had a youthful belief in his bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift called his ’prentice days; and he carried to his studies in London, Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance between intellectual conquest and the social good.",CHAPTER XV.,4.7738996,2.391221,100

2092,"He went to study in Paris with the determination that when he came home again he would settle in some provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the irrational severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the interest of his own scientific pursuits, as well as of the general advance: he would keep away from the range of London intrigues, jealousies, and social truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as Jenner had done, by the independent value of his work.",CHAPTER XV.,7.3619876,2.756454,81
2093,"For it must be remembered that this was a dark period; and in spite of venerable colleges which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by making it scarce, and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in relation to fees and appointments, it happened that very ignorant young gentlemen were promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to practise over large areas in the country.",CHAPTER XV.,6.977962,2.7010794,70
2094,"Also, the high standard held up to the public mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.",CHAPTER XV.,5.753362,3.0472388,95
2095,"Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers.",CHAPTER XV.,6.186828,3.1004198,47
2096,"He meant to be a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an advantageous difference to the viscera of his own patients.",CHAPTER XV.,6.8350496,3.144102,47
2097,But he did not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common.,CHAPTER XV.,7.610146,2.8835049,16

2102,"Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame: each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals.",CHAPTER XV.,8.381207,2.3442461,67
2103,"Lydgate was not blind to the dangers of such friction, but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being seven-and-twenty, he felt himself experienced.",CHAPTER XV.,4.834415,2.0629258,32
2104,"And he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital, but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession.",CHAPTER XV.,7.3127675,3.1103652,51
2105,"There was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other: the careful observation and inference which was his daily work, the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases, would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry.",CHAPTER XV.,7.918046,2.2779698,46
2106,Was not this the typical pre-eminence of his profession?,CHAPTER XV.,7.5075717,2.989003,9
2107,"He would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that very means keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation.",CHAPTER XV.,5.8742046,2.9932892,20
2108,"On one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career: he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality.",CHAPTER XV.,6.989188,2.9921348,58
2109,"He intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach, and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception.",CHAPTER XV.,7.6469984,2.794624,31
2110,"One of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists.",CHAPTER XV.,5.6830783,3.1579185,27
2111,"This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren.",CHAPTER XV.,5.931563,3.2416663,31
2112,"But Lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also, and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary.",CHAPTER XV.,4.732865,2.3820126,38
2113,"Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he were wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young adventurer.",CHAPTER XV.,7.1764975,2.4688473,65
2114,"Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his profession.",CHAPTER XV.,4.64318,2.3150892,16
2115,"The more he became interested in special questions of disease, such as the nature of fever or fevers, the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of Bichat, who died when he was only one-and-thirty, but, like another Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs.",CHAPTER XV.,6.8649807,2.5808938,69
2116,"That great Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies, fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally; but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues, out of which the various organs—brain, heart, lungs, and so on—are compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest, each material having its peculiar composition and proportions.",CHAPTER XV.,7.454034,2.2519658,87

2118,"And the conception wrought out by Bichat, with his detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim, oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments.",CHAPTER XV.,6.80649,2.5832155,58
2119,"But results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of 1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat’s.",CHAPTER XV.,6.846039,2.5727131,50
2120,"This great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net, satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon?",CHAPTER XV.,7.578183,2.179326,59

2124,What was the primitive tissue?,CHAPTER XV.,7.42289,2.1774933,5

2128,"He was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty, without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent, and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for.",CHAPTER XV.,7.563488,2.7853274,70
2129,"He was at a starting-point which makes many a man’s career a fine subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong.",CHAPTER XV.,7.280445,2.9007838,64

2142,"How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so ambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his views of social duty?",CHAPTER XV.,8.397576,3.162469,26
2143,"As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach’s music, or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque.",CHAPTER XV.,8.508221,2.8545911,58
2144,"Lydgate’s spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known (without his telling) that he was better born than other country surgeons.",CHAPTER XV.,5.0298443,2.2091527,73
2145,He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best.,CHAPTER XV.,7.723456,2.442648,49
2146,"As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly, which he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous.",CHAPTER XV.,9.831254,2.5350366,31
2147,"For those who want to be acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable.",CHAPTER XV.,4.8168406,2.224393,52
2148,The story can be told without many words.,CHAPTER XV.,8.388569,3.4309356,8
2149,"It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at the time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some galvanic experiments.",CHAPTER XV.,7.5733037,2.5363092,27
2150,"One evening, tired with his experimenting, and not being able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times; attracted, not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors, but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the piece.",CHAPTER XV.,7.3998933,2.2370636,91
2151,"Lydgate was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to.",CHAPTER XV.,4.934892,1.201841,23
2152,"She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a Greek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a soft cooing.",CHAPTER XV.,9.925141,1.0561644,34
2153,"She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous reputation, her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover.",CHAPTER XV.,10.713688,1.6132891,21
2154,"It was her acting which was “no better than it should be,” but the public was satisfied.",CHAPTER XV.,10.652047,1.495614,17
2155,"Lydgate’s only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman, just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while, without prejudice to his galvanism, to which he would presently return.",CHAPTER XV.,4.9926844,1.4851975,45
2156,But this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe.,CHAPTER XV.,8.565545,2.340174,10
2157,"At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully, the wife veritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed.",CHAPTER XV.,10.333468,1.6804204,31
2158,"A wild shriek pierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this time.",CHAPTER XV.,7.1392064,2.704523,29
2159,"Lydgate leaped and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage, and was active in help, making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms.",CHAPTER XV.,4.896706,1.5602056,37
2160,Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it a murder?,CHAPTER XV.,10.559011,1.4056407,11
2161,"Some of the actress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt, and liked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times); but Lydgate was not one of these.",CHAPTER XV.,4.8997536,1.3276718,34
2162,"He vehemently contended for her innocence, and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before, had passed now into personal devotion, and tender thought of her lot.",CHAPTER XV.,10.528961,1.892314,31
2163,"The notion of murder was absurd: no motive was discoverable, the young couple being understood to dote on each other; and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences.",CHAPTER XV.,8.26341,2.739573,38
2164,The legal investigation ended in Madame Laure’s release.,CHAPTER XV.,4.2352166,3.8726356,8
2165,"Lydgate by this time had had many interviews with her, and found her more and more adorable.",CHAPTER XV.,4.790167,1.2876358,17
2166,She talked little; but that was an additional charm.,CHAPTER XV.,10.59194,1.3802007,9
2167,"She was melancholy, and seemed grateful; her presence was enough, like that of the evening light.",CHAPTER XV.,9.784297,1.1070201,16
2168,"Lydgate was madly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him.",CHAPTER XV.,4.9402266,1.2885758,24
2169,"But instead of reopening her engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she left Paris without warning, forsaking her little court of admirers.",CHAPTER XV.,10.5889,1.3764464,35
2170,"Perhaps no one carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had come to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful comforter.",CHAPTER XV.,4.9997745,1.8062742,35
2171,"Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons.",CHAPTER XV.,4.80731,1.2788085,31
2172,"He found her at last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms.",CHAPTER XV.,10.393387,2.103398,30
2173,"He spoke to her after the play, was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water, and obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent on telling her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him.",CHAPTER XV.,10.460432,1.9260086,50
2174,He knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his habitual foibles.,CHAPTER XV.,8.036322,2.3718925,17
2175,No matter!,CHAPTER XV.,9.111497,6.2801075,2
2176,It was the one thing which he was resolved to do.,CHAPTER XV.,7.755678,3.3006458,11
2177,"He had two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments.",CHAPTER XV.,7.955234,2.5733435,19
2178,"Strange, that some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us.",CHAPTER XV.,8.887423,2.345633,33
2179,To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her.,CHAPTER XV.,10.964043,1.9628595,24
2180,"“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the next day, sitting before him with folded arms, and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.",CHAPTER XV.,9.569412,1.8923291,40
2181,“Are all Englishmen like that?”  “I came because I could not live without trying to see you.,CHAPTER XV.,9.382001,3.9481957,17
2182,"You are lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait, but I want you to promise that you will marry me—no one else.”  Laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids, until he was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt close to her knees.",CHAPTER XV.,10.223338,3.0110404,59
2183,"“I will tell you something,” she said, in her cooing way, keeping her arms folded.",CHAPTER XV.,10.183272,3.6026258,15
2184,"“My foot really slipped.”  “I know, I know,” said Lydgate, deprecatingly.",CHAPTER XV.,4.271871,1.8373657,11
2185,"“It was a fatal accident—a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.”  Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, “I meant to do it.”  Lydgate, strong man as he was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.",CHAPTER XV.,4.7677054,1.6356294,54
2186,"“There was a secret, then,” he said at last, even vehemently.",CHAPTER XV.,10.035551,4.4530663,11
2187,“He was brutal to you: you hated him.”  “No!,CHAPTER XV.,9.537301,4.5454144,9
2188,"he wearied me; he was too fond: he would live in Paris, and not in my country; that was not agreeable to me.”  “Great God!” said Lydgate, in a groan of horror.",CHAPTER XV.,4.747539,1.8523381,32
2189,"“And you planned to murder him?”  “I did not plan: it came to me in the play—I meant to do it.”  Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her.",CHAPTER XV.,4.580851,1.601564,35
2190,He saw this woman—the first to whom he had given his young adoration—amid the throng of stupid criminals.,CHAPTER XV.,10.754128,1.8409212,18

2192,“But I do not like husbands.,CHAPTER XV.,10.236399,3.2462223,6
2193,"I will never have another.”  Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his galvanism again in his Paris chambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him.",CHAPTER XV.,4.4748917,1.7952832,27
2194,He was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better.,CHAPTER XV.,8.003117,2.7522936,23
2195,"But he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment, now that it was so experienced; and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman, entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand.",CHAPTER XV.,9.204177,2.6172945,37
2196,"No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate’s past as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses.",CHAPTER XV.,5.260762,2.2755146,53
2197,"Not only young virgins of that town, but gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality.",CHAPTER XV.,8.282386,2.5078726,46
2198,"Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing Lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably.",CHAPTER XV.,5.4776044,2.3582025,12

2200,The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode.,CHAPTER XVI.,5.1837606,3.3057036,43
2201,"The banker was evidently a ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you to hold a candle to the devil.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.013139,3.3803918,59
2202,"Mr. Bulstrode’s power was not due simply to his being a country banker, who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe—ready to confer obligations, and severe in watching the result.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.43168,4.3970723,54
2203,"He had gathered, as an industrious man always at his post, a chief share in administering the town charities, and his private charities were both minute and abundant.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.3309608,3.312153,28
2204,"He would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker’s son, and he would watch over Tegg’s church-going; he would defend Mrs. Strype the washerwoman against Stubbs’s unjust exaction on the score of her drying-ground, and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs. Strype.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.289636,2.8849583,48
2205,"His private minor loans were numerous, but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.974653,4.4730563,18
2206,"In this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors’ hope and fear as well as gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region, propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external means.",CHAPTER XVI.,8.793382,2.8237433,40
2207,"It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as possible, that he might use it for the glory of God.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.112682,4.4111223,24
2208,"He went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives, and make clear to himself what God’s glory required.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.8178406,2.972569,27
2209,"But, as we have seen, his motives were not always rightly appreciated.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.996357,3.4721966,12
2210,"There were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion that since Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating and drinking so little as he did, and worreting himself about everything, he must have a sort of vampire’s feast in the sense of mastery.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.018014,4.4338536,60
2211,"The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy’s table when Lydgate was dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not, he observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself, though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to Mr. Tyke’s sermons, which were all doctrine, and his preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were free from that taint.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.1614814,3.289865,73
2212,"Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain’s having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher anywhere, and companionable too.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.318651,3.3390715,37
2213,"“What line shall you take, then?” said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy’s.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.058461,2.2443297,18

2216,"I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders, Doctor,” said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.075829,2.7020926,32
2217,"“You medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?”  “I know little of either,” said Lydgate; “but in general, appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.320285,2.9083674,39
2218,The fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable.,CHAPTER XVI.,8.491529,3.9432964,17
2219,"Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and put them out of the question.”  Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most “weight,” though Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more “penetration,” divested his large heavy face of all expression, and looked at his wine-glass while Lydgate was speaking.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.3106213,2.8551655,68
2220,"Whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man—for example, a certain showiness as to foreign ideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by his elders—was positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on Meningitis, of which at least one copy marked “own” was bound in calf.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.386944,2.9226553,62
2221,For my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one’s self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated.,CHAPTER XVI.,8.64388,3.593506,26
2222,"Lydgate’s remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.4824696,2.1802232,11
2223,"Mr. Vincy said, that if he could have his way, he would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere.",CHAPTER XVI.,10.623339,4.8342648,17

2227,"I hope you are not one of the ‘Lancet’s’ men, Mr. Lydgate—wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal profession: your words appear to point that way.”  “I disapprove of Wakley,” interposed Dr. Sprague, “no man more: he is an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of the profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges, for the sake of getting some notoriety for himself.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.7217207,2.406176,71
2228,There are men who don’t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.,CHAPTER XVI.,8.845639,3.4543347,17
2229,"But Wakley is right sometimes,” the Doctor added, judicially.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.577499,2.6969016,9
2230,"“I could mention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.”  “Oh, well,” said Mr. Chichely, “I blame no man for standing up in favor of his own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a coroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training?”  “In my opinion,” said Lydgate, “legal training only makes a man more incompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.8163652,2.5031774,78

2236,"“Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,” said Lydgate.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.751475,2.3102412,12
2237,"“Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so.”  Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his Majesty’s coroner, and ended innocently with the question, “Don’t you agree with me, Dr. Sprague?”  “To a certain extent—with regard to populous districts, and in the metropolis,” said the Doctor.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.75544,2.3459842,92

2244,This was one of the difficulties of moving in good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a qualification for any salaried office.,CHAPTER XVI.,6.34424,2.6154783,26

2259,"“But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.”  Lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation, in thinking how lovely this creature was, her garment seeming to be made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her; and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready, self-possessed grace.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.929432,1.5377716,69

2317,"“I was only going to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know whether you would feel insulted if you were asked to come.”  “Not on the condition I mentioned.”  After this chat Lydgate thought that he was going, but on moving towards the whist-tables, he got interested in watching Mr. Farebrother’s play, which was masterly, and also his face, which was a striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.0844326,2.3792908,74

2328,"Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman—polished, refined, docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence.",CHAPTER XVI.,10.257013,1.9488837,69
2329,"Lydgate felt sure that if ever he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music, that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous, being moulded only for pure and delicate joys.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.9340277,1.4658263,45

2331,"He went home and read far into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details and relations into this pathological study than he had ever thought it necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these being subjects on which he felt himself amply informed by literature, and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial conversation of men.",CHAPTER XVI.,8.172256,2.3049262,66
2332,"Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave him that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power—combining and constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with impartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its own work.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.9340296,3.1548662,61
2333,Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:—reports of very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer coming down on his bad errands as a large ugly man with bat’s wings and spurts of phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to reflect life in a diseased dream.,CHAPTER XVI.,8.430817,2.0342069,64
2334,"But these kinds of inspiration Lydgate regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the imagination that reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of lens, but tracked in that outer darkness through long pathways of necessary sequence by the inward light which is the last refinement of Energy, capable of bathing even the ethereal atoms in its ideally illuminated space.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.8939285,1.8651781,61
2335,"He for his part had tossed away all cheap inventions where ignorance finds itself able and at ease: he was enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research, provisionally framing its object and correcting it to more and more exactness of relation; he wanted to pierce the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares which are the first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness.",CHAPTER XVI.,7.873301,2.529306,89
2336,"As he threw down his book, stretched his legs towards the embers in the grate, and clasped his hands at the back of his head, in that agreeable afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the rest of our existence—seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted strength—Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his profession.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.951991,1.8968062,96

2347,"He had not meant to look at her or speak to her with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed to him that his enjoyment of her music had remained almost silent, for he feared falling into the rudeness of telling her his great surprise at her possession of such accomplishment.",CHAPTER XVI.,10.605762,1.8480463,65
2348,"But Rosamond had registered every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a preconceived romance—incidents which gather value from the foreseen development and climax.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.565283,0.9547655,28
2349,"In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked down on the Middlemarchers.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.876584,1.1372701,107
2350,"It was part of Rosamond’s cleverness to discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she had seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes, and seated among the aristocracy, she had envied them, notwithstanding their plain dress.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.3894553,0.76823306,44
2351,"If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the sense that she was in love with him, I will ask you to use your power of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.9950423,1.3666459,63

2353,"Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception.",CHAPTER XVI.,5.8795633,1.0097373,59
2354,"His looks and words meant more to her than other men’s, because she cared more for them: she thought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection of appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she had yet been conscious of.",CHAPTER XVI.,4.9523425,1.4075423,52
2355,"For Rosamond, though she would never do anything that was disagreeable to her, was industrious; and now more than ever she was active in sketching her landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in practising her music, and in being from morning till night her own standard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her own consciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house.",CHAPTER XVI.,6.514865,0.8996009,78

2524,"That, entering into Lydgate’s position as a new-comer who had his own professional objects to secure, Mr. Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain his interest, showed an unusual delicacy and generosity, which Lydgate’s nature was keenly alive to.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.026859,2.4144409,44

2535,"When the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had a vexed sense that he must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch business.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.2319064,3.1889668,54
2536,"He could not help hearing within him the distinct declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair was a question of office or no office; and he could not help an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.7885466,3.6895666,44

2540,"Then again it was a continually repeated shock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should obviously play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently liking some end which it served.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.0448146,2.727353,34
2541,"Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have played very much less but for the money.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.034727,2.4012022,38

2544,"And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he cared for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.486924,3.3596692,22
2545,"Lydgate was no Puritan, but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had always seemed a meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.8760357,2.320519,46
2546,"Hitherto in his own life his wants had been supplied without any trouble to himself, and his first impulse was always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for getting half-crowns.",CHAPTER XVIII.,7.3517613,3.093572,47

2555,"On the other hand, there was Tyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was simply curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for extra duty.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.2231536,3.3861392,34

2559,"He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against Farebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.758436,3.8498478,55
2560,"Moreover, Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.8255086,2.871143,23

2565,"What he really cared for was a medium for his work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy?",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.5207787,3.2568836,52
2566,"For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.6659827,2.006607,19

2568,"I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances—some feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more difficult.",CHAPTER XVIII.,7.885056,2.947231,33

2576,"The Doctor was more than suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him as if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is probable that his professional weight was the more believed in, the world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas of frilling and sentiment.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.738083,2.8349144,66
2577,It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor which made his neighbors call him hard-headed and dry-witted; conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of judgments connected with drugs.,CHAPTER XVIII.,6.2150903,2.945699,33
2578,"At all events, it is certain that if any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general presumption against his medical skill.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.7641864,3.0279944,47
2579,"On this ground it was (professionally speaking) fortunate for Dr. Minchin that his religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.5453596,3.005449,44
2580,"If Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine of justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr. Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a fortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a particular providence in relation to her stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin for his part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to fixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian Creed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope’s “Essay on Man.” He objected to the rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was generally known that he had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes spent his holidays at “the palace.”  Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline, not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the knees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed necessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him go in and out, and up and down, as if he had come to see after the roofing.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.011941,3.462317,207

2584,"On this ground they were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr. Minchin had never been in open hostility with him, and never differed from him without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found that Dr. Minchin alone understood her constitution.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.454502,3.772018,46
2585,"A layman who pried into the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding his reforms,—though he was less directly embarrassing to the two physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by contract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode, excited by his apparent determination to patronize Lydgate.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.396601,2.9560313,63
2586,"The long-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed that Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode’s purpose.",CHAPTER XVIII.,4.427914,2.6284647,33

2588,"It was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast imputations on his equals, and also to obscure the limit between his own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in the interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various grades,—especially against a man who had not been to either of the English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside study there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in Edinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but hardly sound.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.163843,2.6756907,93
2589,"Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.",CHAPTER XVIII.,5.003985,3.298357,39

2746,"Dorothea had now been five weeks in Rome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently survive in chiller loneliness, she had driven about at first with Mr. Casaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced courier.",CHAPTER XX.,8.354037,-2.3416924,56
2747,"She had been led through the best galleries, had been taken to the chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the most glorious churches, and she had ended by oftenest choosing to drive out to the Campagna where she could feel alone with the earth and sky, away-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her own life too seemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes.",CHAPTER XX.,9.773894,0.98834527,71
2748,"To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world.",CHAPTER XX.,8.529967,0.7196989,45
2749,"But let them conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her small allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the quality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife, and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot.",CHAPTER XX.,9.904027,1.923953,112
2750,The weight of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society; but Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions.,CHAPTER XX.,8.35939,-3.4413364,33
2751,"Ruins and basilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present, where all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the monotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious ideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of breathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her as with an electric shock, and then urged themselves on her with that ache belonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.",CHAPTER XX.,9.159193,1.5420218,117
2752,"Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her young sense, and fixed themselves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them, preparing strange associations which remained through her after-years.",CHAPTER XX.,10.001417,1.1759168,33
2753,"Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the vastness of St. Peter’s, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics above, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading itself everywhere like a disease of the retina.",CHAPTER XX.,9.082309,-2.6978388,79
2754,"Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea’s was anything very exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among incongruities and left to “find their feet” among them, while their elders go about their business.",CHAPTER XX.,8.805632,-3.1067595,37

2760,"However, Dorothea was crying, and if she had been required to state the cause, she could only have done so in some such general words as I have already used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from the endless minutiae by which her view of Mr. Casaubon and her wifely relation, now that she was married to him, was gradually changing with the secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her maiden dream.",CHAPTER XX.,8.502434,-3.1529493,106
2761,"It was too early yet for her fully to recognize or at least admit the change, still more for her to have readjusted that devotedness which was so necessary a part of her mental life that she was almost sure sooner or later to recover it.",CHAPTER XX.,10.369584,1.2202631,46

2769,"Besides, had not Dorothea’s enthusiasm especially dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness with which great tasks lie on him who has to achieve them?— And that such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.",CHAPTER XX.,8.235598,-2.3031564,43

2771,"The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.",CHAPTER XX.,9.782221,2.8344996,56
2772,And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it.,CHAPTER XX.,8.209968,4.1477075,23
2773,"To share lodgings with a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite politician in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in these cases too we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we sometimes end by inverting the quantities.",CHAPTER XX.,7.8970785,3.083482,43
2774,"Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of flashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he was as genuine a character as any ruminant animal, and he had not actively assisted in creating any illusions about himself.",CHAPTER XX.,7.8736067,-0.28731275,39
2775,"How was it that in the weeks since her marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she had dreamed of finding in her husband’s mind were replaced by anterooms and winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither?",CHAPTER XX.,8.5776005,-3.2091777,51
2776,"I suppose it was that in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal.",CHAPTER XX.,9.855002,2.6234322,36

2779,"In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness of their intercourse, and, supported by her faith in their future, she had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments to be brought against Mr. Casaubon’s entirely new view of the Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter she should see this subject which touched him so nearly from the same high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him.",CHAPTER XX.,8.286137,-2.147887,100
2780,"Again, the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he treated what to her were the most stirring thoughts, was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in which she herself shared during their engagement.",CHAPTER XX.,10.002385,1.7839907,41
2781,"But now, since they had been in Rome, with all the depths of her emotion roused to tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements, she had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that her mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and repulsion, or else into forlorn weariness.",CHAPTER XX.,9.859104,1.2761295,59
2782,"How far the judicious Hooker or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr. Casaubon’s time of life, she had no means of knowing, so that he could not have the advantage of comparison; but her husband’s way of commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to affect her with a sort of mental shiver: he had perhaps the best intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting himself.",CHAPTER XX.,8.096719,-0.28682378,77
2783,"What was fresh to her mind was worn out to his; and such capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him by the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried preparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge.",CHAPTER XX.,9.784484,1.3657424,45

2799,"These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon, might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she had been encouraged to pour forth her girlish and womanly feeling—if he would have held her hands between his and listened with the delight of tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up her experience, and would have given her the same sort of intimacy in return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual knowledge and affection—or if she could have fed her affection with those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her bald doll, creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.",CHAPTER XX.,8.182684,-2.075123,132

2977,"Today she had begun to see that she had been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from Mr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment that there might be a sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on his side as on her own.",CHAPTER XXI.,8.471027,-0.2858855,56
2978,"We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her to imagine how she would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is no longer reflection but feeling—an idea wrought back to the directness of sense, like the solidity of objects—that he had an equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and shadows must always fall with a certain difference.",CHAPTER XXI.,8.282396,-2.3075955,102

2986,"He described touches of incident among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who could move about freely; he found himself in agreement with Mr. Casaubon as to the unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the relations of Judaism and Catholicism; and passed easily to a half-enthusiastic half-playful picture of the enjoyment he got out of the very miscellaneousness of Rome, which made the mind flexible with constant comparison, and saved you from seeing the world’s ages as a set of box-like partitions without vital connection.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.0228615,1.0893425,89
2987,"Mr. Casaubon’s studies, Will observed, had always been of too broad a kind for that, and he had perhaps never felt any such sudden effect, but for himself he confessed that Rome had given him quite a new sense of history as a whole: the fragments stimulated his imagination and made him constructive.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.0412245,0.1741323,53

2990,"Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon’s statement that his labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and that after a brief renewal he should have no further reason for staying in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away without seeing a studio or two.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.047074,-0.48033854,57

2995,"Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr. Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he led the way to the studio of his friend Adolf Naumann, whom he mentioned as one of the chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation to which the great souls of all periods became as it were contemporaries.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.015846,0.21542642,86

3012,"They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present; his pictures were advantageously arranged, and his own plain vivacious person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so that everything was as fortunate as if he had expected the beautiful young English lady exactly at that time.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.255848,0.6225121,52
3013,"The painter in his confident English gave little dissertations on his finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as much as he did Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.205718,-1.9601036,26
3014,"Will burst in here and there with ardent words of praise, marking out particular merits in his friend’s work; and Dorothea felt that she was getting quite new notions as to the significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones with the simple country as a background, and of saints with architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in their skulls.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.896495,-2.9009602,63
3015,Some things which had seemed monstrous to her were gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not interested himself.,CHAPTER XXII.,8.432833,-0.22514573,33
3016,"“I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,” said Dorothea, speaking to Will.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.3271675,1.1303267,39

3018,"“He will tell you, it is all pfuscherei, which is his most opprobrious word!”  “Is that true?” said Dorothea, turning her sincere eyes on Naumann, who made a slight grimace and said—  “Oh, he does not mean it seriously with painting.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.2403145,0.7616573,41
3019,His walk must be belles-lettres.,CHAPTER XXII.,7.2350945,2.1150925,5

3022,"The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr. Casaubon, came forward again and said—  “My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas Aquinas in my picture there.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.160619,0.61348194,62

3024,"That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one; and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.”  As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her more, unless it had been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and worthiest among the sons of men.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.323745,-2.257303,51

3031,"Presently Naumann said—“Now if I could lay this by for half an hour and take it up again—come and look, Ladislaw—I think it is perfect so far.”  Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret—  “Ah—now—if I could but have had more—but you have other engagements—I could not ask it—or even to come again to-morrow.”  “Oh, let us stay!” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.258438,0.4993004,76

3034,"“Having given up the interior of my head to idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.”  “You are unspeakably good—now I am happy!” said Naumann, and then went on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he were considering that.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.471339,2.6543612,52
3035,"Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his visitors, and afterwards turning to Mr. Casaubon, said—  “Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of her—not, of course, as you see, for that picture—only as a single study.”  Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him, and Dorothea said, at once, “Where shall I put myself?”  Naumann was all apologies in asking her to stand, and allow him to adjust her attitude, to which she submitted without any of the affected airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when the painter said, “It is as Santa Clara that I want you to stand—leaning so, with your cheek against your hand—so—looking at that stool, please, so!”  Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint’s feet and kiss her robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he was adjusting her arm.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.219187,0.58490485,175

3038,"Naumann took the hint and said—  “Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.”  So Mr. Casaubon’s patience held out further, and when after all it turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.1882515,0.5286706,56

3040,"The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he arranged for the purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented, but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.143254,0.6176633,53
3041,"The Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience, engage to make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the arrangement was conditional.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.236015,0.56754947,39

3095,"Would you turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and moralizing over misery?",CHAPTER XXII.,8.89358,2.5191329,18
3096,"I suspect that you have some false belief in the virtues of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone further than he intended, and checked himself.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.367394,2.5272205,31
3097,"But Dorothea’s thought was not taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered without any special emotion—  “Indeed you mistake me.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.801212,-3.5672002,24
3098,"I am not a sad, melancholy creature.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.937512,3.453485,7

3102,"I should be quite willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don’t know the reason of—so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness rather than beauty.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.9121685,1.7884825,34
3103,"The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.311188,1.1982836,19
3104,"Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that I might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”  “Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things want that soil to grow in.”  “Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current of her anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.111063,-3.2260242,101
3105,"I have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they could be put on the wall.”  Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but changed her mind and paused.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.484199,1.0086938,52
3106,"“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,” said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to him.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.753424,2.845244,26

3111,It makes me savage to think of it!,CHAPTER XXII.,8.993802,5.637563,8
3112,"I would rather never have seen you than think of you with such a prospect.”  Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach to words depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so much kindness in it for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings around her, that she felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a gentle smile—  “It is very good of you to be anxious about me.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.984299,-3.4758182,95
3113,It is because you did not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of life.,CHAPTER XXII.,9.455057,-0.20059964,19
3114,"But Lowick is my chosen home.”  The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to embrace her slippers, and tell her that he would die for her: it was clear that she required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at last what had been in her mind beforehand.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.767493,-2.4199934,83
3115,“I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.,CHAPTER XXII.,9.838779,4.7218204,13

3119,I have been thinking about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must have before him the same materials as German scholars—has he not?” Dorothea’s timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she was in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.,CHAPTER XXII.,8.284048,-2.1951551,56
3120,"“Not exactly the same materials,” said Will, thinking that he would be duly reserved.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.386742,3.114978,14

3130,"I wonder it does not affect you more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has been the labor of his best years.” She was beginning to be shocked that she had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for having led her to it.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.006438,-0.31166244,67

3154,"To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of emotion—a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling, and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.07232,3.3025124,59
3155,"One may have that condition by fits only.”  “But you leave out the poems,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.9801855,-3.4904735,16

3158,"But I am sure I could never produce a poem.”  “You are a poem—and that is to be the best part of a poet—what makes up the poet’s consciousness in his best moods,” said Will, showing such originality as we all share with the morning and the spring-time and other endless renewals.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.045423,3.3815794,52
3159,"“I am very glad to hear it,” said Dorothea, laughing out her words in a bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her eyes.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.247908,-3.1104374,27

3172,"If he never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off receiving favors from him, it would clearly be permissible to hate him the more.",CHAPTER XXII.,7.820948,-0.1896803,28
3173,"The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at least ready with that accomplishment.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.141292,3.2491183,18
3174,"He said that he must go now without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he would come to take leave of at the last moment.",CHAPTER XXII.,7.8887415,-0.17562,24
3175,"Dorothea gave him her hand, and they exchanged a simple “Good-by.”  But going out of the porte cochere he met Mr. Casaubon, and that gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his cousin, politely waived the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.35154,-2.2684188,53
3176,"“I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I think will heighten your opinion of him,” said Dorothea to her husband in the course of the evening.",CHAPTER XXII.,7.4474363,-2.3574834,31
3177,"She had mentioned immediately on his entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr. Casaubon had said, “I met him outside, and we made our final adieux, I believe,” saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish for a further remark upon it.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.158242,-0.06282934,65
3178,So Dorothea had waited.,CHAPTER XXII.,8.860844,-3.5443122,4

3183,“Did he mention the precise order of occupation to which he would addict himself?”  “No.,CHAPTER XXII.,8.133976,3.6734118,15

3185,Of course he will write to you about it.,CHAPTER XXII.,8.2862425,4.024243,9

3189,"“I had a duty towards him,” said Mr. Casaubon, laying his other hand on Dorothea’s in conscientious acceptance of her caress, but with a glance which he could not hinder from being uneasy.",CHAPTER XXII.,8.291612,-2.2310178,33
3190,"“The young man, I confess, is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I think, discuss his future course, which it is not ours to determine beyond the limits which I have sufficiently indicated.” Dorothea did not mention Will again.",CHAPTER XXII.,9.120712,-3.4411447,44

3192,"Whate’er they be, I’ll eat my head,     But I will beat them hollow.”  Fred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his mind, and though no such immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman for many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.14333,5.1785917,55
3193,"The creditor was Mr. Bambridge, a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company was much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be “addicted to pleasure.” During the vacations Fred had naturally required more amusements than he had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been accommodating enough not only to trust him for the hire of horses and the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a small advance by which he might be able to meet some losses at billiards.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.0504165,5.000657,86
3194,The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.961554,5.1619196,9
3195,"Bambridge was in no alarm about his money, being sure that young Vincy had backers; but he had required something to show for it, and Fred had at first given a bill with his own signature.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.593241,6.045029,36
3196,Three months later he had renewed this bill with the signature of Caleb Garth.,CHAPTER XXIII.,11.869697,6.5550604,14
3197,"On both occasions Fred had felt confident that he should meet the bill himself, having ample funds at disposal in his own hopefulness.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.64846,5.8453326,23
3198,"You will hardly demand that his confidence should have a basis in external facts; such confidence, we know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is a comfortable disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of providence or the folly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the still greater mystery of our high individual value in the universe, will bring about agreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good taste in costume, and our general preference for the best style of thing.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.135855,3.3887045,86
3199,"Fred felt sure that he should have a present from his uncle, that he should have a run of luck, that by dint of “swapping” he should gradually metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that would fetch a hundred at any moment—“judgment” being always equivalent to an unspecified sum in hard cash.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.509073,5.3543053,55
3200,"And in any case, even supposing negations which only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always (at that time) his father’s pocket as a last resource, so that his assets of hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.890158,5.350296,41
3201,"Of what might be the capacity of his father’s pocket, Fred had only a vague notion: was not trade elastic?",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.741913,5.536016,20

3203,"The Vincys lived in an easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the family habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of economy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion that their father might pay for anything if he would.",CHAPTER XXIII.,10.589994,4.8234544,50
3204,"Mr. Vincy himself had expensive Middlemarch habits—spent money on coursing, on his cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running accounts with tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting everything one wants without any question of payment.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.2806635,3.9834738,39
3205,"But it was in the nature of fathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there was always a little storm over his extravagance if he had to disclose a debt, and Fred disliked bad weather within doors.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.6509075,5.5335126,38
3206,"He was too filial to be disrespectful to his father, and he bore the thunder with the certainty that it was transient; but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see his mother cry, and also to be obliged to look sulky instead of having fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he looked glum under scolding, it was chiefly for propriety’s sake.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.880142,5.170253,65
3207,"The easier course plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend’s signature.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.5553694,5.559438,13
3208,Why not?,CHAPTER XXIII.,8.874661,6.538294,2
3209,"With the superfluous securities of hope at his command, there was no reason why he should not have increased other people’s liabilities to any extent, but for the fact that men whose names were good for anything were usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that the universal order of things would necessarily be agreeable to an agreeable young gentleman.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.743818,3.309117,58
3210,"With a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to their more amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and concerning each in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that he will be eager to oblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as other warmth.",CHAPTER XXIII.,9.223738,2.7466757,53
3211,"Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed as but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened that Fred checked off all his friends but one, on the ground that applying to them would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that he at least (whatever might be maintained about mankind generally) had a right to be free from anything disagreeable.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.837879,5.3661275,64
3212,"That he should ever fall into a thoroughly unpleasant position—wear trousers shrunk with washing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to “duck under” in any sort of way—was an absurdity irreconcilable with those cheerful intuitions implanted in him by nature.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.8702574,2.4712203,46
3213,And Fred winced under the idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.,CHAPTER XXIII.,11.572705,5.8201866,17

3215,"The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he was of them; for when he and Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone’s double marriage (the first to Mr. Garth’s sister, and the second to Mrs. Vincy’s) had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the children rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out of their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.724327,4.4257126,83
3216,"Mary was a little hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her the nicest girl in the world, making her his wife with a brass ring which he had cut from an umbrella.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.66726,4.3957887,34
3217,"Through all the stages of his education he had kept his affection for the Garths, and his habit of going to their house as a second home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of his family had long ceased.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.680249,2.3529181,41
3218,"Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the Vincys were on condescending terms with him and his wife, for there were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but equals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible theoretically.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.1353664,2.425606,62
3219,"Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building business, which he had unfortunately added to his other avocations of surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time entirely for the benefit of his assignees, and had been living narrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he might after all pay twenty shillings in the pound.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.928026,5.435709,59
3220,"He had now achieved this, and from all who did not think it a bad precedent, his honorable exertions had won him due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded on esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete dinner-service.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.5263505,2.9597254,46
3221,"Mrs. Vincy had never been at her ease with Mrs. Garth, and frequently spoke of her as a woman who had had to work for her bread—meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her marriage; in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall’s Questions was something like a draper’s discrimination of calico trademarks, or a courier’s acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better off needed that sort of thing.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.315159,4.492485,75
3222,"And since Mary had been keeping Mr. Featherstone’s house, Mrs. Vincy’s want of liking for the Garths had been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents “lived in such a small way.” Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his visits to Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing ardor of his affection for Mary inclining him the more towards those who belonged to her.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.4435835,4.8116875,83
3223,"Mr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went with his request.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.96596,4.524776,17
3224,"He obtained it without much difficulty, for a large amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth cautious about his own affairs, or distrustful of his fellow-men when they had not proved themselves untrustworthy; and he had the highest opinion of Fred, was “sure the lad would turn out well—an open affectionate fellow, with a good bottom to his character—you might trust him for anything.” Such was Caleb’s psychological argument.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.9178505,6.574634,73
3225,He was one of those rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to others.,CHAPTER XXIII.,7.875584,2.7381668,16
3226,"He had a certain shame about his neighbors’ errors, and never spoke of them willingly; hence he was not likely to divert his mind from the best mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in order to preconceive those errors.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.553466,2.949154,41
3227,"If he had to blame any one, it was necessary for him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various diagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work than find fault with their doing.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.5475535,3.2069755,55
3228,I fear he was a bad disciplinarian.,CHAPTER XXIII.,7.8804736,2.7822626,7
3229,"When Fred stated the circumstances of his debt, his wish to meet it without troubling his father, and the certainty that the money would be forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb pushed his spectacles upward, listened, looked into his favorite’s clear young eyes, and believed him, not distinguishing confidence about the future from veracity about the past; but he felt that it was an occasion for a friendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving his signature he must give a rather strong admonition.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.821758,6.3522234,89
3230,"Accordingly, he took the paper and lowered his spectacles, measured the space at his command, reached his pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again, then pushed the paper a little way from him, lifted up his spectacles again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows, which gave his face a peculiar mildness (pardon these details for once—you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb Garth), and said in a comfortable tone,—  “It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse’s knees?",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.939383,6.478574,96
3231,"And then, these exchanges, they don’t answer when you have ’cute jockeys to deal with.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.3756447,5.0050097,15
3232,"You’ll be wiser another time, my boy.”  Whereupon Caleb drew down his spectacles, and proceeded to write his signature with the care which he always gave to that performance; for whatever he did in the way of business he did well.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.901491,6.5452633,41
3233,"He contemplated the large well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his head a trifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said “Good-by,” and returned forthwith to his absorption in a plan for Sir James Chettam’s new farm-buildings.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.616049,5.19295,42
3234,"Either because his interest in this work thrust the incident of the signature from his memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more conscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.8521385,6.548561,33
3235,"Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred’s sky, which altered his view of the distance, and was the reason why his uncle Featherstone’s present of money was of importance enough to make his color come and go, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a proportionate disappointment.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.404824,5.3065205,51
3236,"His failure in passing his examination, had made his accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his father, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.419734,3.9428997,28
3237,"Mr. Vincy had sworn that if he had anything more of that sort to put up with, Fred should turn out and get his living how he could; and he had never yet quite recovered his good-humored tone to his son, who had especially enraged him by saying at this stage of things that he did not want to be a clergyman, and would rather not “go on with that.” Fred was conscious that he would have been yet more severely dealt with if his family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him as Mr. Featherstone’s heir; that old gentleman’s pride in him, and apparent fondness for him, serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct—just as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of his being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.130836,5.138719,160
3238,"In fact, tacit expectations of what would be done for him by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his own consciousness, what uncle Featherstone would do for him in an emergency, or what he would do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable depth of aerial perspective.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.130405,5.1835685,59
3239,"But that present of bank-notes, once made, was measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt, showed a deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred’s “judgment” or by luck in some other shape.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.515391,5.858292,39
3240,"For that little episode of the alleged borrowing, in which he had made his father the agent in getting the Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to his father for money towards meeting his actual debt.",CHAPTER XXIII.,4.9471436,4.157591,38
3241,"Fred was keen enough to foresee that anger would confuse distinctions, and that his denial of having borrowed expressly on the strength of his uncle’s will would be taken as a falsehood.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.724478,5.415438,32
3242,"He had gone to his father and told him one vexatious affair, and he had left another untold: in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.110589,2.950126,32
3243,"Now Fred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even fibs; he often shrugged his shoulders and made a significant grimace at what he called Rosamond’s fibs (it is only brothers who can associate such ideas with a lovely girl); and rather than incur the accusation of falsehood he would even incur some trouble and self-restraint.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.540934,4.8733416,57
3244,It was under strong inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise step of depositing the eighty pounds with his mother.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.744714,5.5333915,24
3245,"It was a pity that he had not at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he meant to make the sum complete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he had kept twenty pounds in his own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which, planted by judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than threefold—a very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman’s infinite soul, with all the numerals at command.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.6723437,5.3325663,79
3246,"Fred was not a gambler: he had not that specific disease in which the suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as necessary as the dram to the drunkard; he had only the tendency to that diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is carried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and having no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there must be to others in going aboard with it.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.935956,5.4947515,93
3247,"Hopefulness has a pleasure in making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is certain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as possible a share in the stake.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.818369,2.7928543,35
3248,"Fred liked play, especially billiards, as he liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he only liked it the better because he wanted money and hoped to win.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.884173,5.4847217,28
3249,But the twenty pounds’ worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive green plot—all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the roadside—and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he had deposited with his mother.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.6710486,5.49888,54
3250,"The broken-winded horse which he rode represented a present which had been made to him a long while ago by his uncle Featherstone: his father always allowed him to keep a horse, Mr. Vincy’s own habits making him regard this as a reasonable demand even for a son who was rather exasperating.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.4744287,5.0286856,52
3251,"This horse, then, was Fred’s property, and in his anxiety to meet the imminent bill he determined to sacrifice a possession without which life would certainly be worth little.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.4404087,5.315452,29
3252,"He made the resolution with a sense of heroism—heroism forced on him by the dread of breaking his word to Mr. Garth, by his love for Mary and awe of her opinion.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.962882,4.134109,32
3253,"He would start for Houndsley horse-fair which was to be held the next morning, and—simply sell his horse, bringing back the money by coach?—Well, the horse would hardly fetch more than thirty pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it would be folly to balk himself of luck beforehand.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.4284225,5.2615504,51
3254,"It was a hundred to one that some good chance would fall in his way; the longer he thought of it, the less possible it seemed that he should not have a good chance, and the less reasonable that he should not equip himself with the powder and shot for bringing it down.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.3411083,2.6685216,53
3255,"He would ride to Houndsley with Bambridge and with Horrock “the vet,” and without asking them anything expressly, he should virtually get the benefit of their opinion.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.182406,5.059527,27
3256,"Before he set out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his mother.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.7504234,5.507679,12
3257,"Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with Bambridge and Horrock, on his way of course to Houndsley horse-fair, thought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he himself would have had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a gay young fellow.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.0621314,5.0493364,64
3258,"Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not been to the university, and that he had written stanzas as pastoral and unvoluptuous as his flute-playing, his attraction towards Bambridge and Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.746322,5.291119,75
3259,"Under any other name than “pleasure” the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse in a stable, His Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit of these things was “gay.”  In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which offered play to the imagination.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.007451,5.033564,118
3260,"Costume, at a glance, gave him a thrilling association with horses (enough to specify the hat-brim which took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending downwards), and nature had given him a face which by dint of Mongolian eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his hat-brim in a moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund of humor—too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable crust,—and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it, would be the thing and no other.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.418466,2.2211857,130
3261,"It is a physiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.886417,4.415225,27
3262,"Mr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his horse’s fetlock, turned sideways in his saddle, and watched the horse’s action for the space of three minutes, then turned forward, twitched his own bridle, and remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it had been.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.13335,4.9845953,49
3263,The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.053187,4.969804,12
3264,"A mixture of passions was excited in Fred—a mad desire to thrash Horrock’s opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the advantage of his friendship.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.704995,5.350944,26
3265,There was always the chance that Horrock might say something quite invaluable at the right moment.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.0508842,5.0039907,16
3266,"Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his ideas without economy.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.0528445,4.9802547,15
3267,"He was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken of as being “given to indulgence”—chiefly in swearing, drinking, and beating his wife.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.5863013,2.781158,21
3268,"Some people who had lost by him called him a vicious man; but he regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.590801,2.4942641,35
3269,"He was undeniably a prosperous man, bore his drinking better than others bore their moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green bay-tree.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.3328004,3.0016496,24
3270,"But his range of conversation was limited, and like the fine old tune, “Drops of brandy,” gave you after a while a sense of returning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy.",CHAPTER XXIII.,8.657481,2.8873892,36
3271,But a slight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to several circles in Middlemarch; and he was a distinguished figure in the bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon.,CHAPTER XXIII.,5.9066486,4.7268305,34
3272,"He knew some anecdotes about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his memory was chiefly shown about the horses he had himself bought and sold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without turning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of passionate asseveration, in which he would assist the imagination of his hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.",CHAPTER XXIII.,7.4142175,2.2291763,96
3273,"In short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.",CHAPTER XXIII.,5.929152,4.9453177,13
3274,"Fred was subtle, and did not tell his friends that he was going to Houndsley bent on selling his horse: he wished to get indirectly at their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent critics.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.3637943,5.3246317,51
3275,It was not Mr. Bambridge’s weakness to be a gratuitous flatterer.,CHAPTER XXIII.,5.9938,5.0085154,11

3286,"When they slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said—  “Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.”  “I’m quite satisfied with his paces, I know,” said Fred, who required all the consciousness of being in gay company to support him; “I say his trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?”  Mr. Horrock looked before him with as complete a neutrality as if he had been a portrait by a great master.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.0271893,5.032893,73
3287,"Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on reflection he saw that Bambridge’s depreciation and Horrock’s silence were both virtually encouraging, and indicated that they thought better of the horse than they chose to say.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.205294,5.1832585,40
3288,"That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his horse, but an opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in bringing with him his eighty pounds.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.49221,5.3241386,41
3289,"A young farmer, acquainted with Mr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation about parting with a hunter, which he introduced at once as Diamond, implying that it was a public character.",CHAPTER XXIII.,6.075762,4.8634615,35

3294,"He felt sure that if he did not come to a bargain with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with all the constructive power of suspicion.",CHAPTER XXIII.,11.733874,5.3508363,38
3295,Bambridge had run down Diamond in a way that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he had not thought of buying it; every one who looked at the animal—even Horrock—was evidently impressed with its merit.,CHAPTER XXIII.,6.099712,5.067484,40

3313,"Even if he had applied to his father on the plea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly that his father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the consequence of what he would call encouraging extravagance and deceit.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.5611,5.515211,44
3314,"He was so utterly downcast that he could frame no other project than to go straight to Mr. Garth and tell him the sad truth, carrying with him the fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of his own hands.",CHAPTER XXIV.,12.239444,4.240849,43
3315,"His father, being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the accident: when he did, he would storm about the vicious brute being brought into his stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred wanted to get away with all his courage to face the greater.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.651837,5.5306582,47
3316,"He took his father’s nag, for he had made up his mind that when he had told Mr. Garth, he would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.873771,4.2415857,30
3317,"In fact, it is probable that but for Mary’s existence and Fred’s love for her, his conscience would have been much less active both in previously urging the debt on his thought and impelling him not to spare himself after his usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as directly and simply as he could.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.875068,4.8520126,58

3320,Certainly it would have made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary Garth had had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character.,CHAPTER XXIV.,11.872015,4.548524,28
3321,"Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his house, which was a little way outside the town—a homely place with an orchard in front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.763877,4.361466,57

3324,"Fred liked it too, knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples and quinces, and until to-day he had never come to it without pleasant expectations; but his heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he should probably have to make his confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom he was rather more in awe than of her husband.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.860911,5.0099077,64
3325,"Not that she was inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.476815,3.178494,14
3326,"In her present matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by over-hasty speech; having, as she said, borne the yoke in her youth, and learned self-control.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.952204,4.030812,28

3329,"She had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in teapots or children’s frilling, and had never poured any pathetic confidences into the ears of her feminine neighbors concerning Mr. Garth’s want of prudence and the sums he might have had if he had been like other men.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.897629,4.029932,48
3330,"Hence these fair neighbors thought her either proud or eccentric, and sometimes spoke of her to their husbands as “your fine Mrs. Garth.” She was not without her criticism of them in return, being more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and—where is the blameless woman?—apt to be a little severe towards her own sex, which in her opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.869863,4.070601,66
3331,"On the other hand, she was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural.",CHAPTER XXIV.,10.047994,2.2617893,23
3332,"Also, it must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her resistance to what she held to be follies: the passage from governess into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her consciousness, and she rarely forgot that while her grammar and accent were above the town standard, she wore a plain cap, cooked the family dinner, and darned all the stockings.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.893778,4.204971,68
3333,"She had sometimes taken pupils in a peripatetic fashion, making them follow her about in the kitchen with their book or slate.",CHAPTER XXIV.,9.742091,0.8548433,22
3334,"She thought it good for them to see that she could make an excellent lather while she corrected their blunders “without looking,”—that a woman with her sleeves tucked up above her elbows might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid Zone—that, in short, she might possess “education” and other good things ending in “tion,” and worthy to be pronounced emphatically, without being a useless doll.",CHAPTER XXIV.,9.801194,1.0126296,67
3335,"When she made remarks to this edifying effect, she had a firm little frown on her brow, which yet did not hinder her face from looking benevolent, and her words which came forth like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto.",CHAPTER XXIV.,10.252422,1.518385,43
3336,"Certainly, the exemplary Mrs. Garth had her droll aspects, but her character sustained her oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor of skin.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.894506,4.116287,25
3337,"Towards Fred Vincy she had a motherly feeling, and had always been disposed to excuse his errors, though she would probably not have excused Mary for engaging herself to him, her daughter being included in that more rigorous judgment which she applied to her own sex.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.432631,4.5823245,46
3338,But this very fact of her exceptional indulgence towards him made it the harder to Fred that he must now inevitably sink in her opinion.,CHAPTER XXIV.,11.975646,4.9201474,25
3339,And the circumstances of his visit turned out to be still more unpleasant than he had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at some repairs not far off.,CHAPTER XXIV.,11.859913,6.590548,32
3340,"Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in the kitchen, and this morning she was carrying on several occupations at once there—making her pies at the well-scoured deal table on one side of that airy room, observing Sally’s movements at the oven and dough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her youngest boy and girl, who were standing opposite to her at the table with their books and slates before them.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.806402,4.1707077,73

3345,"Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter would become like her, which is a prospective advantage equal to a dowry—the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a malignant prophecy—“Such as I am, she will shortly be.”  “Now let us go through that once more,” said Mrs. Garth, pinching an apple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a heavy brow, from due attention to the lesson.",CHAPTER XXIV.,11.307813,3.9546788,74

4459,"The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old gentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to have a funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old Featherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been devoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who would drive a bargain with his undertaker beforehand.",CHAPTER XXXIV.,10.686662,5.641186,65

4474,"Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he declined duty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to him as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the land in the shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old man, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit through with an inward snarl.",CHAPTER XXXIV.,10.728283,5.6817217,74

4480,"She was not fond of visiting that house, but she liked, as she said, to see collections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral; and she had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the Rector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be altogether pleasant.",CHAPTER XXXIV.,8.560681,-1.1424834,56

4484,"The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the room occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he had been forbidden to work; but he had resumed nearly his habitual style of life now in spite of warnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs. Cadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite mistake about Cush and Mizraim.",CHAPTER XXXIV.,8.440394,-0.6085644,66

4584,"Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone up-stairs with the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule, seeing two vacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had the spirit to move next to that great authority, who was handling his watch-seals and trimming his outlines with a determination not to show anything so compromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.",CHAPTER XXXV.,10.74526,6.0896173,68

4611,"As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter suspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter’s former and latter intentions as to create endless “lawing” before anybody came by their own—an inconvenience which would have at least the advantage of going all round.",CHAPTER XXXV.,10.642557,5.988861,65

4780,"The indirect though emphatic expression of opinion to which Mr. Vincy was prone suffered much restraint in this case: Lydgate was a proud man towards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and throwing his hat on the floor was out of the question.",CHAPTER XXXVI.,5.19005,2.2017047,42
4781,"Mr. Vincy was a little in awe of him, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little indisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a man better educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little afraid of doing what his daughter would not like.",CHAPTER XXXVI.,10.6815195,4.7300835,66

4957,Hence it seemed desirable that Lydgate should by-and-by get some first-rate position elsewhere than in Middlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in the case of a man who had a titled uncle and could make discoveries.,CHAPTER XXXVI.,5.0316043,2.3236537,37

4966,"Buyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous position: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given up the “Pioneer”—which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in the van of progress—because it had taken Peel’s side about the Papists, and had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of Jesuitry and Baal; but they were ill-satisfied with the “Trumpet,” which—since its blasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of the public mind (nobody knowing who would support whom)—had become feeble in its blowing.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.0357394,-0.14031334,91

5025,"Clouds gathered with treacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take shelter in the house.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.895829,1.0433453,19
5026,"He intended, on the strength of relationship, to go into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and seeing his old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t mention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr. Casaubon does not like to be disturbed when he is in the library.”  “Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.133941,-0.58409154,69
5027,"I’d better tell her you’re here, sir,” said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given to lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her that it must be dull for Madam.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.133684,-0.111220844,30
5028,"“Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,” said Will, feeling so happy that he affected indifference with delightful ease.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.945321,2.2528512,23
5029,"In another minute he was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him with her sweet unconstrained smile.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.112579,-3.1016004,18
5030,“Mr.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,0.7890459,-2.852877,1
5031,"Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.159811,-0.46373817,10
5032,“I don’t know whether he will be at home again long before dinner.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.337235,4.2663393,13
5033,He was uncertain how long he should be.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.388881,3.2109268,8
5034,"Did you want to say anything particular to him?”  “No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.929552,2.3218083,20
5035,Else I would not have disturbed you yet.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.362315,5.115467,8
5036,"I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know he dislikes interruption at this hour.”  “I am indebted to the rain, then.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.910964,-0.48803145,23
5037,"I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea uttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy child, visited at school.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.332654,-3.2402194,23
5038,"“I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,” said Will, mysteriously forced to be just as simple as she was.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.925913,3.3348887,22
5039,"He could not stay to ask himself, why not?",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.232325,3.7639625,9
5040,"“I wanted to talk about things, as we did in Rome.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.523772,0.70369655,11
5041,"It always makes a difference when other people are present.”  “Yes,” said Dorothea, in her clear full tone of assent.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.079837,-3.4389913,20
5042,"“Sit down.” She seated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her, looking in her plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without a single ornament on her besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under a vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite her at two yards’ distance, the light falling on his bright curls and delicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip and chin.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.409118,0.84662825,79
5043,Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers which had opened then and there.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.90029,1.3382162,18
5044,Dorothea for the moment forgot her husband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at her thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had found receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she exaggerated a past solace.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.450977,-3.2979753,43
5045,"“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she said, immediately.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.177974,4.2327356,16
5046,"“It seems strange to me how many things I said to you.”  “I remember them all,” said Will, with the unspeakable content in his soul of feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be perfectly loved.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.732592,3.476698,41
5047,"I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect, for we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the completeness of the beloved object.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.571158,2.4771152,28
5048,"“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.074547,-3.4941432,15
5049,"“I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand just a little Greek.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.502756,0.65582794,16
5050,I can help Mr. Casaubon better now.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.7617407,-0.46877638,7
5051,I can find out references for him and save his eyes in many ways.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.673494,3.8689616,14
5052,"But it is very difficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too tired.”  “If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he is likely to overtake them before he is decrepit,” said Will, with irrepressible quickness.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.6322155,2.8946896,56
5053,"But through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and seeing her face change, he added, immediately, “But it is quite true that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out their ideas.”  “You correct me,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.745482,-3.316255,41
5054,“I expressed myself ill.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.829502,4.6915913,4
5055,I should have said that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working them out.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.879292,3.275171,18
5056,"I used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life would be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen might be lighter.”  Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of making a revelation.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.68422,-3.3873136,63
5057,But she had never before said anything to Will which threw so strong a light on her marriage.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.549365,2.3338666,18
5058,He did not shrug his shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he thought the more irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses ecclesiastically enshrined.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.114945,2.6521928,29
5059,Also he had to take care that his speech should not betray that thought.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.051858,3.0725138,14
5060,"“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get over-wrought yourself.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.317844,4.5121474,15
5061,Are you not too much shut up?,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.152099,5.323014,7
5062,You already look paler.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.373612,2.6808932,4
5063,It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he could easily get a man who would do half his work for him.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.8464236,-0.4847103,25
5064,"It would save him more effectually, and you need only help him in lighter ways.”  “How can you think of that?” said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest remonstrance.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.854568,-3.6010382,29
5065,“I should have no happiness if I did not help him in his work.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.265508,4.199879,14
5066,What could I do?,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.290222,5.8512225,4
5067,There is no good to be done in Lowick.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.364966,-0.14418688,9
5068,The only thing I desire is to help him more.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.008836,4.1689796,10
5069,"And he objects to a secretary: please not to mention that again.”  “Certainly not, now I know your feeling.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.716522,-0.43454573,19
5070,"But I have heard both Mr. Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.”  “Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a great deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new conservatories, to fill up my days.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.100333,-1.8687893,44
5071,"I thought you could understand that one’s mind has other wants,” she added, rather impatiently—“besides, Mr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.”  “My mistake is excusable,” said Will.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9812164,-0.4298758,30
5072,“In old days I used to hear Mr. Casaubon speak as if he looked forward to having a secretary.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.841869,-0.61892337,19
5073,Indeed he held out the prospect of that office to me.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.324395,3.5610597,11
5074,"But I turned out to be—not good enough for it.”  Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her husband’s evident repulsion, as she said, with a playful smile, “You were not a steady worker enough.”  “No,” said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of a spirited horse.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.860034,-3.3539627,54
5075,"And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to give another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory, he went on, “And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any one to overlook his work and know thoroughly what he is doing.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.034177,-0.3857051,48
5076,He is too doubtful—too uncertain of himself.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.180385,3.5761828,7
5077,"I may not be good for much, but he dislikes me because I disagree with him.”  Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our tongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before general intentions can be brought to bear.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.661786,3.357367,45
5078,And it was too intolerable that Casaubon’s dislike of him should not be fairly accounted for to Dorothea.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.265429,-2.2699068,18
5079,Yet when he had spoken he was rather uneasy as to the effect on her.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.463089,1.7911881,15
5080,"But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had been on a like occasion in Rome.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.743563,-3.3549373,17
5081,And the cause lay deep.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.8804326,3.5977924,5
5082,"She was no longer struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting herself to their clearest perception; and now when she looked steadily at her husband’s failure, still more at his possible consciousness of failure, she seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became tenderness.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.412921,1.5617913,48
5083,"Will’s want of reticence might have been met with more severity, if he had not already been recommended to her mercy by her husband’s dislike, which must seem hard to her till she saw better reason for it.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.876366,1.8586847,38
5084,"She did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she said, with some earnestness, “Mr.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.643638,3.085881,17
5085,Casaubon must have overcome his dislike of you so far as his actions were concerned: and that is admirable.”  “Yes; he has shown a sense of justice in family matters.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.8676243,-0.27298424,30
5086,"It was an abominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited because she made what they called a mesalliance, though there was nothing to be said against her husband except that he was a Polish refugee who gave lessons for his bread.”  “I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.548576,-3.4990165,52
5087,“I wonder how she bore the change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with her husband!,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.481386,2.8292146,20
5088,Do you know much about them?”  “No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak many languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.941356,3.175531,27
5089,They both died rather early.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.187862,2.0699983,5
5090,"And I never knew much of my father, beyond what my mother told me; but he inherited the musical talents.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.021733,3.7965896,20
5091,"I remember his slow walk and his long thin hands; and one day remains with me when he was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had only a little bit of bread.”  “Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen interest, clasping her hands on her lap.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.941297,-3.1228166,52
5092,“I have always had too much of everything.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.534834,4.688052,8
5093,But tell me how it was—Mr.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,0.7581855,-2.8845305,6
5094,"Casaubon could not have known about you then.”  “No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was my last hungry day.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9174347,-0.51956207,26
5095,"My father died soon after, and my mother and I were well taken care of.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.167459,4.050387,15
5096,Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his duty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had been shown to his mother’s sister.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9101753,-0.26930422,27
5097,"But now I am telling you what is not new to you.”  In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what was rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr. Casaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.295746,-2.2952943,48
5098,Will was much too good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.499646,2.1188154,16
5099,And when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of escaping from its bonds.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.7483015,3.6876326,18
5100,"“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.973649,-3.5405972,4
5101,Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on his own honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct was depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his relations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.559538,-0.31418234,40
5102,"After a moment’s pause, she added, “He had never told me that he supported your mother.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.777398,3.337004,16
5103,Is she still living?”  “No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.139207,2.1086671,13
5104,"It is curious that my mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her husband.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.788719,2.9121647,20
5105,"She never would tell me anything about her family, except that she forsook them to get her own living—went on the stage, in fact.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.706756,2.778526,24
5106,"She was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be getting old.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.912275,1.3043746,15
5107,"You see I come of rebellious blood on both sides,” Will ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she was still looking with serious intentness before her, like a child seeing a drama for the first time.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.46005,-3.3341084,36
5108,"But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your apology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean, to Mr. Casaubon’s wishes.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.53716,-0.34571508,29
5109,You must remember that you have not done what he thought best for you.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.782683,4.1330266,14
5110,"And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of dislike a little while ago—but I should rather say, if he has shown any painful feelings towards you, you must consider how sensitive he has become from the wearing effect of study.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.668258,3.420283,40
5111,"Perhaps,” she continued, getting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told you how serious Mr. Casaubon’s illness was.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.235287,-0.54213285,20
5112,"It would be very petty of us who are well and can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who carry a weight of trial.”  “You teach me better,” said Will.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.391152,4.435461,34
5113,“I will never grumble on that subject again.” There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the unutterable contentment of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly conscious of—that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity and loyalty towards her husband.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.606723,-3.4160645,42
5114,"Will was ready to adore her pity and loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.890194,1.9006838,19
5115,"“I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on, “but I will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would disapprove.”  “That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.359678,-3.4584491,40
5116,"“I shall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.592069,3.9288232,12
5117,"But you will soon go away, out of my rule, I imagine.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.5472765,5.232288,12
5118,You will soon be tired of staying at the Grange.”  “That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I wished to speak to you alone.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.0925994,-0.39808515,31
5119,Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in this neighborhood.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,6.675811,-1.3098203,10
5120,"He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”  “Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.341544,-3.20157,36
5121,"“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and not settling to anything.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.10347,4.339993,16
5122,And here is something offered to me.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.8681126,5.382213,7
5123,"If you would not like me to accept it, I will give it up.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.092889,5.3480735,14
5124,Otherwise I would rather stay in this part of the country than go away.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.429162,5.0856824,14
5125,"I belong to nobody anywhere else.”  “I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as simply and readily as she had spoken at Rome.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.232091,-3.4465723,28
5126,There was not the shadow of a reason in her mind at the moment why she should not say so.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.8628235,1.6644343,20
5127,"“Then I will stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising and going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,5.7599673,-0.11777642,25
5128,"But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting continually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt differently from herself, and she colored deeply under the double embarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her husband’s feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.465648,-3.2606297,53
5129,"His face was not turned towards her, and this made it easier to say—  “But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.422625,1.8494616,25
5130,I think you should be guided by Mr. Casaubon.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.8779826,-0.4407354,9
5131,"I spoke without thinking of anything else than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real question.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.224006,3.7533262,20
5132,But it now occurs to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that the proposal was not wise.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9394283,-0.27630442,16
5133,"Can you not wait now and mention it to him?”  “I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility that Mr. Casaubon would enter.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.825371,-0.23927945,26
5134,“The rain is quite over now.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.545522,4.892343,6

5136,"I shall strike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.707329,1.2204354,14
5137,"I like that.”  He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not daring to say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he dared not, could not say it.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.224342,-0.48011646,32
5138,To ask her to be less simple and direct would be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light through.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,10.290484,1.2311709,24
5139,And there was always the other great dread—of himself becoming dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.45928,1.6061718,17
5140,"“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of mournfulness, as she rose and put out her hand.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.106575,-3.2157176,21
5141,"She also had her thought which she did not like to express:—Will certainly ought to lose no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s wishes, but for her to urge this might seem an undue dictation.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.453425,-0.12128163,34
5142,"So they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking across the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr. Casaubon’s carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until four o’clock.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9505935,0.14363696,37
5143,"That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too early to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his person for dinner, and too late to undress his mind of the day’s frivolous ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the serious business of study.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.85887,1.9366742,54
5144,"On such occasions he usually threw into an easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London papers to him, closing his eyes the while.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.601774,-3.0127726,27
5145,"To-day, however, he declined that relief, observing that he had already had too many public details urged upon him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea asked about his fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which never forsook him even when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—  “I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr. Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy recipient of praise.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,8.905068,-3.3438478,80
5146,"He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on the Egyptian Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become me to repeat.” In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over the elbow of his chair, and swayed his head up and down, apparently as a muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which would not have been becoming.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,7.9311414,-0.2751581,59
5147,"“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted to see her husband less weary than usual at this hour.",CHAPTER XXXVII.,9.162587,-3.1851926,23

5149,“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of my uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband she felt was really concerned in this question.,CHAPTER XXXVII.,5.795851,-0.22468933,34

5859,It is true that this last might be called his central ambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the consciousness of the author—one knows of the river by a few streaks amid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.040946,2.3455825,52

5870,To his suspicious interpretation Dorothea’s silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a remark from her which he had not in any way anticipated was an assertion of conscious superiority; her gentle answers had an irritating cautiousness in them; and when she acquiesced it was a self-approved effort of forbearance.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.688603,-3.3920918,49

5883,"As to Will, though until his last defiant letter he had nothing definite which he would choose formally to allege against him, he felt himself warranted in believing that he was capable of any design which could fascinate a rebellious temper and an undisciplined impulsiveness.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.237108,2.2345285,45
5884,"He was quite sure that Dorothea was the cause of Will’s return from Rome, and his determination to settle in the neighborhood; and he was penetrating enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently encouraged this course.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.282574,-3.3408833,36
5885,"It was as clear as possible that she was ready to be attached to Will and to be pliant to his suggestions: they had never had a tête-à-tête without her bringing away from it some new troublesome impression, and the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was aware of (Dorothea, on returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first time been silent about having seen Will) had led to a scene which roused an angrier feeling against them both than he had ever known before.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.2299185,-2.1022801,84
5886,"Dorothea’s outpouring of her notions about money, in the darkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a mixture of more odious foreboding into her husband’s mind.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.595154,-3.1848993,28
5887,And there was the shock lately given to his health always sadly present with him.,CHAPTER XLII.,7.932013,2.4023669,15
5888,"He was certainly much revived; he had recovered all his usual power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there might still be twenty years of achievement before him, which would justify the thirty years of preparation.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.2533617,2.6561897,40
5889,"That prospect was made the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp & Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his taper among the tombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and interrupted his diligent exploration.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.987937,-0.0045823287,47
5890,"To convince Carp of his mistake, so that he would have to eat his own words with a good deal of indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship, which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.996812,2.6361947,51
5891,"Since, thus, the prevision of his own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other persons, when he himself should have entered into glory, had not a potently sweetening effect.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.614838,2.4789042,50
5892,"If the truth should be that some undermining disease was at work within him, there might be large opportunity for some people to be the happier when he was gone; and if one of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his disembodied existence.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.0861754,-0.5167843,59
5893,This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the case.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.013582,4.969951,15
5894,"The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we know, had a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the requirements of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons for his conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.91463,-0.16560028,43
5895,The way in which Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:—“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had to care for her well-being in case of my death.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.105634,-2.2822623,26
5896,"But well-being is not to be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on the contrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might expose her to the more danger.",CHAPTER XLII.,10.162937,2.5450027,30
5897,"She is ready prey to any man who knows how to play adroitly either on her affectionate ardor or her Quixotic enthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his mind—a man with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a personal animosity towards me—I am sure of it—an animosity which is fed by the consciousness of his ingratitude, and which he has constantly vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had heard it.",CHAPTER XLII.,10.102129,2.1934154,85
5898,Even if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what he may attempt through indirect influence.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.057982,4.0372553,19
5899,This man has gained Dorothea’s ear: he has fascinated her attention; he has evidently tried to impress her mind with the notion that he has claims beyond anything I have done for him.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.640333,-3.509687,33
5900,If I die—and he is waiting here on the watch for that—he will persuade her to marry him.,CHAPTER XLII.,10.60599,2.5402286,18
5901,That would be calamity for her and success for him.,CHAPTER XLII.,10.896872,1.9883282,10
5902,"She would not think it calamity: he would make her believe anything; she has a tendency to immoderate attachment which she inwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her mind is occupied with his fortunes.",CHAPTER XLII.,10.843453,2.3066897,37

5909,When was sciolism ever dissociated from laxity?,CHAPTER XLII.,7.294893,2.3021472,7
5910,"I utterly distrust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to the utmost the fulfilment of his designs.”  The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his marriage left strong measures open to him, but in ruminating on them his mind inevitably dwelt so much on the probabilities of his own life that the longing to get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his proud reticence, and had determined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the nature of his illness.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.491991,-0.36435422,84
5911,"He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at half-past three, and in answer to her anxious question, whether he had felt ill, replied,—“No, I merely wish to have his opinion concerning some habitual symptoms.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.9121957,-2.7828345,38
5912,"You need not see him, my dear.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.759074,4.073114,7
5913,"I shall give orders that he may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be taking my usual exercise.”  When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he saw Mr. Casaubon slowly receding with his hands behind him according to his habit, and his head bent forward.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.4721003,-0.44903308,49
5914,"It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the lights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the cawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that last solemn lullaby, a dirge.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.744285,1.0570967,52
5915,"Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame in its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he was likely soon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him showed more markedly than ever the signs of premature age—the student’s bent shoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.",CHAPTER XLII.,4.8699455,1.8986473,52
5916,"“Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his years are like lions; one can tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.”  “Mr.",CHAPTER XLII.,9.413374,3.943417,26

5922,"Were I assured that this is the utmost I can reasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful circumscription of my attempts, and a guide in both the positive and negative determination of my course.”  Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his back and thrust it between the buttons of his single-breasted coat.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.016141,-0.6161478,55

5924,"Nay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the significance of its life—a significance which is to vanish as the waters which come and go where no man has need of them?",CHAPTER XLII.,8.750833,2.5724323,49
5925,"But there was nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate, who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little amusement mingling with his pity.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.5214353,-0.37795335,31
5926,He was at present too ill acquainted with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the sufferer.,CHAPTER XLII.,8.177168,2.4610384,32

5932,"If not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.”  “Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,” said Lydgate; “but the first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly uncertain—uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.",CHAPTER XLII.,8.421859,3.841034,59

5939,"I could add no information to this beyond anatomical or medical details, which would leave expectation at precisely the same point.” Lydgate’s instinct was fine enough to tell him that plain speech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be felt by Mr. Casaubon as a tribute of respect.",CHAPTER XLII.,7.471209,-0.37218523,48

6159,"What the opposition in Middlemarch said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody shall not be an originator; but there were differences which represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr. Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.3976126,2.8848302,65
6160,"Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her own asseveration, that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your leave or with your leave; for it was a known “fac” that he had wanted to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street, who had money in trust before her marriage—a poor tale for a doctor, who if he was good for anything should know what was the matter with you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you were gone.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.287702,1.4225264,111
6161,"If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what was; but there was a prevalent feeling in her audience that her opinion was a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits to the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare with their pitch-plaisters—such a hanging business as that was not wanted in Middlemarch!",CHAPTER XLV.,9.725158,1.3199447,65
6162,"And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic public-house—the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop’s—was the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to the vote whether its long-standing medical man, “Doctor Gambit,” should not be cashiered in favor of “this Doctor Lydgate,” who was capable of performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether given up by other practitioners.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.273112,2.8141544,83

6165,"A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of Lydgate’s skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided, depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.8668766,2.3749683,61
6166,"Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn threadbare, like old Featherstone’s, had been at once inclined to try him; also, many who did not like paying their doctor’s bills, thought agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him without stint if the children’s temper wanted a dose, occasions when the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined to employ Lydgate held it likely that he was clever.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.6749973,2.9757545,80

6185,"Moreover, in addition to the massive benefit of the drugs to “self and family,” he had enjoyed the pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit—a practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he was wont to say in an undertone, he placed Gambit above any of them.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.4871097,2.805436,90

6234,Pass the wine.”  Mr. Toller’s prediction was partly verified.,CHAPTER XLV.,6.0852137,3.161843,9
6235,"If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey, who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his supposed declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he did “use all the means he might use” in the case.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.072248,2.6612306,50
6236,"Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his mind disturbed with doubts during his wife’s attack of erysipelas, and could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs. Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a remarkably hot August.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.4242964,2.7091482,89
6237,"At last, indeed, in the conflict between his desire not to hurt Lydgate and his anxiety that no “means” should be lacking, he induced his wife privately to take Widgeon’s Purifying Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.056252,2.581327,52
6238,"This co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr. Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it might be attended with a blessing.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.786101,2.4570854,30
6239,But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate’s introduction he was helped by what we mortals rashly call good fortune.,CHAPTER XLV.,4.699679,2.4812512,19
6240,"I suppose no doctor ever came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody—cures which may be called fortune’s testimonials, and deserve as much credit as the written or printed kind.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.8405886,3.225337,33
6241,"Various patients got well while Lydgate was attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it was remarked that the new doctor with his new ways had at least the merit of bringing people back from the brink of death.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.2699623,2.8630767,40
6242,"The trash talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it gave precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and unscrupulous man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him by the simmering dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his own part of ignorant puffing.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.971224,2.366925,55
6243,But even his proud outspokenness was checked by the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog; and “good fortune” insisted on using those interpretations.,CHAPTER XLV.,7.995577,2.9379792,35
6244,"Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming symptoms in her charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him to see her then and there, and to give her a certificate for the Infirmary; whereupon after examination he wrote a statement of the case as one of tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.413201,2.2787375,57
6245,"Nancy, calling at home on her way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and his wife, in whose attic she lodged, to read Dr. Minchin’s paper, and by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at first declared to be as large and hard as a duck’s egg, but later in the day to be about the size of “your fist.” Most hearers agreed that it would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of “squitchineal” as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body when taken enough of into the inside—the oil by gradually “soopling,” the squitchineal by eating away.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.4094567,2.509561,124
6246,"Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to be one of Lydgate’s days there.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.8232946,1.3141421,17
6247,"After questioning and examining her, Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, “It’s not tumor: it’s cramp.” He ordered her a blister and some steel mixture, and told her to go home and rest, giving her at the same time a note to Mrs. Larcher, who, she said, was her best employer, to testify that she was in need of good food.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.234459,2.4275181,63
6248,"But by-and-by Nancy, in her attic, became portentously worse, the supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only wandered to another region with angrier pain.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.3824306,2.3314505,28
6249,"The staymaker’s wife went to fetch Lydgate, and he continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy in her own home, until under his treatment she got quite well and went to work again.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.708363,1.2450846,33
6250,"But the case continued to be described as one of tumor in Churchyard Lane and other streets—nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for when Lydgate’s remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he naturally did not like to say, “The case was not one of tumor, and I was mistaken in describing it as such,” but answered, “Indeed!",CHAPTER XLV.,5.294338,2.2827992,57
6251,ah!,CHAPTER XLV.,9.284808,6.295735,1
6252,"I saw it was a surgical case, not of a fatal kind.” He had been inwardly annoyed, however, when he had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he had recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what had occurred: he privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general practitioner to contradict a physician’s diagnosis in that open manner, and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably inattentive to etiquette.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.1158514,2.4455502,86
6253,"Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for valuing himself or (very particularly) despising Minchin, such rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal qualifications.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.80922,2.3240092,27
6254,"But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate’s method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his marvellous skill in the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she had been rolling and rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.3218746,1.9796225,74
6255,How could Lydgate help himself?,CHAPTER XLV.,4.637774,2.2716248,5

6259,"In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he won.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.072173,2.6505148,35
6260,"The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having been a patient of Mr. Peacock’s, sent for Lydgate, whom he had expressed his intention to patronize.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.1969676,2.6056585,26
6261,"Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a good subject for trying the expectant theory upon—watching the course of an interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so that the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air with which he described his sensations Lydgate surmised that he would like to be taken into his medical man’s confidence, and be represented as a partner in his own cure.",CHAPTER XLV.,6.46031,2.8308253,73
6262,"The auctioneer heard, without much surprise, that his was a constitution which (always with due watching) might be left to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a disease with all its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he probably had the rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test of a rational procedure, and thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a general benefit to society.",CHAPTER XLV.,6.590507,2.9265475,72
6263,"Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view that an illness of his was no ordinary occasion for medical science.",CHAPTER XLV.,6.683499,2.7512012,23

6265,"And he went without shrinking through his abstinence from drugs, much sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the importance of his temperature, by the sense that he furnished objects for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited to the dignity of his secretions.",CHAPTER XLV.,7.7310724,2.5024912,49
6266,For Lydgate was acute enough to indulge him with a little technical talk.,CHAPTER XLV.,4.5707865,2.3000627,13
6267,It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his couch with a disposition to speak of an illness in which he had manifested the strength of his mind as well as constitution; and he was not backward in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of patient he had to deal with.,CHAPTER XLV.,6.6604133,2.7367709,57
6268,"The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man, and liked to give others their due, feeling that he could afford it.",CHAPTER XLV.,7.209819,4.088424,20
6269,"He had caught the words “expectant method,” and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate “knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors—was far better versed in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers.”  This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy’s illness had given to Mr. Wrench’s enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.0729113,2.6377823,71
6270,"The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard-driven elders, who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions.",CHAPTER XLV.,7.381228,2.7871037,44
6271,"His practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment.",CHAPTER XLV.,7.8345685,2.1312785,62
6272,"There was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.5635834,2.503254,36
6273,"That Mr. Farebrother, whose name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended Lydgate and made a friend of him, was referred to Farebrother’s unaccountable way of fighting on both sides.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.779587,2.8743231,33
6274,"Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards the building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old Infirmary.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.096761,3.7058713,68
6275,"Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he had had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.092743,4.361255,43
6276,"Caleb Garth had undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business; and when referring to the Hospital he often said that however Bulstrode might ring if you tried him, he liked good solid carpentry and masonry, and had a notion both of drains and chimneys.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.7202444,4.188578,59
6277,"In fact, the Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any Board; but he had another favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment: he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the Hospital.",CHAPTER XLV.,5.0637317,3.7665658,70
6278,Meanwhile he framed his plan of management.,CHAPTER XLV.,7.571175,3.6298625,7
6279,"The Hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms; Lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent, that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies, particularly in Paris, had shown him the importance of, the other medical visitors having a consultative influence, but no power to contravene Lydgate’s ultimate decisions; and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers, and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government.",CHAPTER XLV.,4.961795,3.2519696,111

6450,"For the first time he felt offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr. Brooke.",CHAPTER XLVI.,4.8704233,2.0205026,31

6480,"Its effect when he went to his own rooms was to make him sit up half the night, thinking over again, under a new irritation, all that he had before thought of his having settled in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke.",CHAPTER XLVII.,7.4327073,1.9443178,43
6481,Hesitations before he had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to every hint that he would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came his heat towards Lydgate—a heat which still kept him restless.,CHAPTER XLVII.,4.8176694,2.0658085,38
6482,Was he not making a fool of himself?—and at a time when he was more than ever conscious of being something better than a fool?,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.039331,2.979803,25
6483,And for what end?,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.807659,4.655837,4
6484,"Well, for no definite end.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.715879,4.60357,5
6485,"True, he had dreamy visions of possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and thoughts does not think in consequence of his passions—does not find images rising in his mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting it with dread.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.35276,2.3230643,44
6486,"But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit “keeps the roadway:” he had his bypaths where there were little joys of his own choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have thought rather idiotic.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.379685,1.9368068,51
6487,The way in which he made a sort of happiness for himself out of his feeling for Dorothea was an example of this.,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.603881,-3.481644,23
6488,"It may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him—namely, that Dorothea might become a widow, and that the interest he had established in her mind might turn into acceptance of him as a husband—had no tempting, arresting power over him; he did not live in the scenery of such an event, and follow it out, as we all do with that imagined “otherwise” which is our practical heaven.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.2436905,-2.2571266,79
6489,"It was not only that he was unwilling to entertain thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped to turn away his imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr. Casaubon.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.18544,-2.0986605,66
6490,And there were yet other reasons.,CHAPTER XLVII.,7.8697,3.5233939,6
6491,"Will, we know, could not bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his crystal: he was at once exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea looked at him and spoke to him, and there was something so exquisite in thinking of her just as she was, that he could not long for a change which must somehow change her.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.399255,-3.2071598,63
6492,"Do we not shun the street version of a fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of chiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day possession?",CHAPTER XLVII.,6.7404304,4.192509,57
6493,"Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our emotion; and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to have within him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was like the inheritance of a fortune.",CHAPTER XLVII.,9.019779,-3.439114,53
6494,"What others might have called the futility of his passion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.17721,2.3693054,39
6495,"Dorothea, he said to himself, was forever enthroned in his soul: no other woman could sit higher than her footstool; and if he could have written out in immortal syllables the effect she wrought within him, he might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,—  “Queens hereafter might be glad to live Upon the alms of her superfluous praise.”  But this result was questionable.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.431663,-3.0460804,66
6496,And what else could he do for Dorothea?,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.606628,-3.5451615,8
6497,What was his devotion worth to her?,CHAPTER XLVII.,10.502656,1.7470924,7
6498,It was impossible to tell.,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.485539,3.1535356,5
6499,He would not go out of her reach.,CHAPTER XLVII.,11.08245,2.0384293,8
6500,He saw no creature among her friends to whom he could believe that she spoke with the same simple confidence as to him.,CHAPTER XLVII.,10.845122,1.7770739,23
6501,"She had once said that she would like him to stay; and stay he would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss around her.",CHAPTER XLVII.,10.991232,2.4080098,22
6502,This had always been the conclusion of Will’s hesitations.,CHAPTER XLVII.,8.681023,2.2032764,9
6503,But he was not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his own resolve.,CHAPTER XLVII.,7.8700905,2.9284067,13
6504,"He had often got irritated, as he was on this particular night, by some outside demonstration that his public exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he would like them to be, and this was always associated with the other ground of irritation—that notwithstanding his sacrifice of dignity for Dorothea’s sake, he could hardly ever see her.",CHAPTER XLVII.,7.887979,-2.1451094,63
6505,"Whereupon, not being able to contradict these unpleasant facts, he contradicted his own strongest bias and said, “I am a fool.”  Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea, he ended, as he had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of what her presence would be to him; and suddenly reflecting that the morrow would be Sunday, he determined to go to Lowick Church and see her.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.5395,-3.2796423,70
6506,"He slept upon that idea, but when he was dressing in the rational morning light, Objection said—  “That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon’s prohibition to visit Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.”  “Nonsense!” argued Inclination, “it would be too monstrous for him to hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring morning.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.274143,-2.2893338,60
6507,"And Dorothea will be glad.”  “It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy him or to see Dorothea.”  “It is not true that I go to annoy him, and why should I not go to see Dorothea?",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.316695,-2.28342,43

6510,"I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation; besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.”  Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick as if he had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green growths piercing the brown.",CHAPTER XLVII.,7.0126314,3.5008786,74

6512,"Will easily felt happy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine on the water—though the occasion was not exemplary.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.174045,-0.04978784,49
6513,"But most of us are apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is odious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his personality excites in ourselves.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.58415,3.4295268,36
6514,"Will went along with a small book under his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but chanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and coming out.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.771178,2.7132044,35
6515,"He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.068674,1.9883289,19

 “The tremor of a banished fear,      An ill that was not done— O me, O me, what frugal cheer     My love doth feed upon!”  Sometimes, when he took off his hat, shaking his head backward, and showing his delicate throat as he sang, he looked like an incarnation of the spring whose spirit filled the air—a bright creature, abundant in uncertain promises.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.381963,2.0918438,100
6518,"The bells were still ringing when he got to Lowick, and he went into the curate’s pew before any one else arrived there.",CHAPTER XLVII.,6.8834224,2.907623,23

6520,"The curate’s pew was opposite the rector’s at the entrance of the small chancel, and Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he looked round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and there with age, but yet has young shoots.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.699591,-2.9843462,76
6521,"Mr. Rigg’s frog-face was something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel’s cheek had the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters generally—the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all betters, and the one most awful if offended.",CHAPTER XLVII.,8.432722,1.595616,95

6569,"This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent participation in my purpose.”  This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon’s original reluctance to let Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition, namely, to demand much interest and labor from her.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,8.34673,-2.384397,88

6571,"It is not wearisome to you, I trust, Dorothea?”  “I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,” said Dorothea, who told the simple truth; for what she dreaded was to exert herself in reading or anything else which left him as joyless as ever.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,9.0387,-3.3919168,46

6575,"Dorothea in her young weariness had slept soon and fast: she was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed to her at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she had climbed a steep hill: she opened her eyes and saw her husband wrapped in his warm gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the embers were still glowing.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,8.981568,-2.9049644,64

6583,"Mr. Casaubon’s mind was more alert, and he seemed to anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication, saying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the next head—I omit the second excursus on Crete.” Dorothea was amazed to think of the bird-like speed with which his mind was surveying the ground where it had been creeping for years.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,8.339633,-2.0139334,61

6593,"“It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.”  Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her to the conjecture of some intention on her husband’s part which might make a new yoke for her.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,9.000448,-3.4086447,69

6605,The poor child had become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key which had made the ambition and the labor of her husband’s life.,CHAPTER XLVIII.,10.239209,2.0566928,26
6606,"It was not wonderful that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in this matter was truer than his: for she looked with unbiassed comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he had risked all his egoism.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,10.605238,1.7547728,39
6607,"And now she pictured to herself the days, and months, and years which she must spend in sorting what might be called shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,9.48711,1.0347378,55

6609,But Mr. Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares against discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible: it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for threading the stars together.,CHAPTER XLVIII.,8.083547,0.4558549,95

6612,"At first it had seemed that he wished to keep even her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing; but gradually the terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too speedy death—  And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s past—nay, to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs; and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him!",CHAPTER XLVIII.,8.66364,-3.2246938,93
6613,"And had she not wished to marry him that she might help him in his life’s labor?—But she had thought the work was to be something greater, which she could serve in devoutly for its own sake.",CHAPTER XLVIII.,10.527663,1.7549332,37

8035,"Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred’s peculiar relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that he should have to go away without saying a word to her in private.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.533258,4.5215287,55
8036,He told her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with her father; and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news touched her keenly.,CHAPTER LVII.,11.392403,3.7636929,29

8039,"“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a young man giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean that things being so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent man like your father.”  “No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary, cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.522981,4.2004657,67

8044,"But why should you dislike clergymen?”  “Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to consider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”  “Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some anxiety.",CHAPTER LVII.,9.85351,0.7085693,39

8052,"At the end he said with quiet satisfaction, “That is right;” and then bent to look at Mary’s labels and praise her handwriting.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.105571,3.7307346,23
8053,"Fred felt horribly jealous—was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so estimable, but wished that he had been ugly and fat as men at forty sometimes are.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.563226,4.883055,28
8054,"It was clear what the end would be, since Mary openly placed Farebrother above everybody, and these women were all evidently encouraging the affair.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.404622,3.4798543,24

8056,"Pray come too, Miss Garth.",CHAPTER LVII.,12.294501,4.1433334,5

8060,"It was as she had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of the study, and she had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother said—  “Wait here a minute or two.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.706358,4.638379,36

8076,"“Fred,” she said, peeping round to catch his eyes, which were sulkily turned away from her, “you are too delightfully ridiculous.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.555911,4.8585086,21
8077,"If you were not such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to play the wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you has made love to me.”  “Do you really like me best, Mary?” said Fred, turning eyes full of affection on her, and trying to take her hand.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.46151,4.4142337,54

8084,"I am disappointed that you should be so blind to his delicate feeling.”  There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with the engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a jealous dread in his heart, but yet with comforting arguments from Mary’s words and manner.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.525591,4.702778,55
8085,"The result of the conversation was on the whole more painful to Mary: inevitably her attention had taken a new attitude, and she saw the possibility of new interpretations.",CHAPTER LVII.,11.40988,3.3531768,29
8086,"She was in a position in which she seemed to herself to be slighting Mr. Farebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is always dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman.",CHAPTER LVII.,10.972045,4.192027,37

8097,"This misfortune was attributed entirely to her having persisted in going out on horseback one day when her husband had desired her not to do so; but it must not be supposed that she had shown temper on the occasion, or rudely told him that she would do as she liked.",CHAPTER LVIII.,10.461171,1.7025858,51
8098,"What led her particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit from Captain Lydgate, the baronet’s third son, who, I am sorry to say, was detested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop “parting his hair from brow to nape in a despicable fashion” (not followed by Tertius himself), and showing an ignorant security that he knew the proper thing to say on every topic.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.174443,0.7008676,67
8099,"Lydgate inwardly cursed his own folly that he had drawn down this visit by consenting to go to his uncle’s on the wedding-tour, and he made himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond by saying so in private.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.5674524,1.1952511,36
8100,For to Rosamond this visit was a source of unprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation.,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.5632052,0.9667016,14
8101,"She was so intensely conscious of having a cousin who was a baronet’s son staying in the house, that she imagined the knowledge of what was implied by his presence to be diffused through all other minds; and when she introduced Captain Lydgate to her guests, she had a placid sense that his rank penetrated them as if it had been an odor.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.023687,1.4098564,63
8102,"The satisfaction was enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the conditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed now that her marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her above the Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and visits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence for Tertius.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.6138725,0.5417747,63

8104,Hence it was clearly worth while for Rosamond to take pains with her music and the careful selection of her lace.,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.5136247,0.90768695,21
8105,"As to Captain Lydgate himself, his low brow, his aquiline nose bent on one side, and his rather heavy utterance, might have been disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military bearing and mustache to give him what is doted on by some flower-like blond heads as “style.” He had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which consists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class gentility, and he was a great critic of feminine charms.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.111477,1.7588662,78
8106,"Rosamond delighted in his admiration now even more than she had done at Quallingham, and he found it easy to spend several hours of the day in flirting with her.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.3796134,1.0861399,30
8107,"The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest larks he had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he suspected that his queer cousin Tertius wished him away: though Lydgate, who would rather (hyperbolically speaking) have died than have failed in polite hospitality, suppressed his dislike, and only pretended generally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the task of answering him to Rosamond.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.862749,0.9464155,67
8108,"For he was not at all a jealous husband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone with his wife to bearing him company.",CHAPTER LVIII.,9.550443,2.6469238,24

8110,"“You really look so absent sometimes—you seem to be seeing through his head into something behind it, instead of looking at him.”  “My dear Rosy, you don’t expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass as that, I hope,” said Lydgate, brusquely.",CHAPTER LVIII.,8.822834,1.6336337,44
8111,"“If he got his head broken, I might look at it with interest, not before.”  “I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so contemptuously,” said Rosamond, her fingers moving at her work while she spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in it.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.246969,1.1329937,50

8114,"“It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,” she answered, “but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman, and I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him with neglect.”  “No, dear; but we have had dinners for him.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.2829556,1.3317281,48

8118,I think his conversation is quite agreeable.,CHAPTER LVIII.,9.140743,3.785607,7
8119,"And he is anything but an unprincipled man.”  “The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him, Rosy,” said Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not exactly tender, and certainly not merry.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.056054,1.8694129,43
8120,Rosamond was silent and did not smile again; but the lovely curves of her face looked good-tempered enough without smiling.,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.648248,1.1619813,20
8121,"Those words of Lydgate’s were like a sad milestone marking how far he had travelled from his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored wisdom alone.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.5519238,1.2216043,61
8122,"He had begun to distinguish between that imagined adoration and the attraction towards a man’s talent because it gives him prestige, and is like an order in his button-hole or an Honorable before his name.",CHAPTER LVIII.,7.5780406,2.6899378,35
8123,"It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she had found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly wearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable—else, indeed, what would become of social bonds?",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.1200333,1.2450763,48
8124,"Captain Lydgate’s stupidity was delicately scented, carried itself with “style,” talked with a good accent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.3544564,1.409963,22
8125,Rosamond found it quite agreeable and caught many of its phrases.,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.505956,1.209753,11
8126,"Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were plenty of reasons why she should be tempted to resume her riding when Captain Lydgate, who had ordered his man with two horses to follow him and put up at the “Green Dragon,” begged her to go out on the gray which he warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady—indeed, he had bought it for his sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.839144,1.315487,78
8127,"Rosamond went out the first time without telling her husband, and came back before his return; but the ride had been so thorough a success, and she declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he was informed of it with full reliance on his consent that she should go riding again.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.548639,1.1947104,53
8128,On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt—he was utterly confounded that she had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the matter to his wish.,CHAPTER LVIII.,4.8954415,1.3288376,27
8129,"After the first almost thundering exclamations of astonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he was silent for some moments.",CHAPTER LVIII.,7.0419345,1.2088237,22

8134,"I think it is enough that I say you are not to go again.”  Rosamond was arranging her hair before dinner, and the reflection of her head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a little turning aside of the long neck.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.821152,1.2230674,45
8135,"Lydgate had been moving about with his hands in his pockets, and now paused near her, as if he awaited some assurance.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.776707,1.348089,22

8151,"The temptation was certainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir Godwin’s son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in this position by any one but her husband, was something as good as her dreams before marriage: moreover she was riveting the connection with the family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.4543304,1.1698794,75
8152,"But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being felled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her baby.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.8240685,1.1929117,38

8158,He had regarded Rosamond’s cleverness as precisely of the receptive kind which became a woman.,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.484727,1.2872041,15
8159,He was now beginning to find out what that cleverness was—what was the shape into which it had run as into a close network aloof and independent.,CHAPTER LVIII.,8.25722,2.4268222,27
8160,"No one quicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the track of her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s preeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively tracing still more agreeable social effects when his talent should have advanced him; but for her, his professional and scientific ambition had no other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.659505,1.1712041,76

8168,"Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she inwardly called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.930666,1.5955744,62

8171,"To Lydgate it seemed that he had been spending month after month in sacrificing more than half of his best intent and best power to his tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and interruptions without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the blank unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more impersonal ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor which he had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as sublime, though not in the least knowing why.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.0170164,1.1426473,99

8175,"And on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a simple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading care, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.846197,1.9639325,34
8176,"This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to Rosamond; and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered her mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.621988,1.0504867,34
8177,"It was an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily drawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he could not succeed in keeping out of his mind for long together that he was every day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it with such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.696597,2.2051404,61

8182,"When a man in setting up a house and preparing for marriage finds that his furniture and other initial expenses come to between four and five hundred pounds more than he has capital to pay for; when at the end of a year it appears that his household expenses, horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds of the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred, chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he minds it or not, he is in debt.",CHAPTER LVIII.,7.040787,5.0397196,106
8183,"Those were less expensive times than our own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease with which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought that he was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied without stint, and who paid an insurance on his life and a high rent for house and garden, might find his expenses doubling his receipts, can be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath his consideration.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.9444127,4.744543,82
8184,"Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to an extravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply in ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate supposed that “if things were done at all, they must be done properly”—he did not see how they were to live otherwise.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.970056,1.1660498,47
8185,"If each head of household expenditure had been mentioned to him beforehand, he would have probably observed that “it could hardly come to much,” and if any one had suggested a saving on a particular article—for example, the substitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have appeared to him simply a penny-wise, mean notion.",CHAPTER LVIII.,7.142901,4.278662,54

8199,"He had scorned even to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters, and nothing but extremity could have induced him to apply to his father-in-law, even if he had not been made aware in various indirect ways since his marriage that Mr. Vincy’s own affairs were not flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him would be resented.",CHAPTER LVIII.,10.618813,4.7536693,61
8200,"Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had never in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should need to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but now that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather incur any other hardship.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.799688,2.387415,58

8203,"New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his reasoning into a new channel of comparison: he had begun to consider from a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in goods ordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits.",CHAPTER LVIII.,7.317958,3.6255443,45
8204,How could such a change be made without Rosamond’s concurrence?,CHAPTER LVIII.,6.554747,1.1303495,10
8205,The immediate occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was forced upon him.,CHAPTER LVIII.,10.754378,1.8607175,14
8206,"Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security could possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered the one good security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who was a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself the upholsterer’s credit also, accepting interest for a given term.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.9312544,2.3088288,60
8207,"The security necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his house, which might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a debt amounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith, Mr. Dover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the plate and any other article which was as good as new.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.911252,4.8187227,62

8209,"Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some may think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man like Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in the pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered no conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not proportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s ridiculous fastidiousness about asking his friends for money.",CHAPTER LVIII.,4.8704743,2.354348,74
8210,"However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine morning when he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence of other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of which the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for ornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond’s neck and arms could hardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.",CHAPTER LVIII.,6.88834,4.8332,74

8318,"“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you will return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper, and Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let it fall on his knee.",CHAPTER LVIII.,5.952759,0.9113639,46

8391,"This was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr. Larcher’s great success in the carrying business, which warranted his purchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by an illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural.",CHAPTER LX.,6.117129,2.6358695,71
8392,"Hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without reserve, comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.",CHAPTER LX.,6.546599,2.5796568,48
8393,At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival.,CHAPTER LX.,6.1366415,2.623806,15
8394,"There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a superior funeral; and facilities were offered for that generous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles.",CHAPTER LX.,7.794466,0.9706863,36
8395,"Mr. Larcher’s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as the Shrubs.",CHAPTER LX.,5.3172,3.5991538,57
8396,"In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all classes with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the races.",CHAPTER LX.,6.86933,4.3977423,39
8397,"The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold, “everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter’s, had looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and had rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock.",CHAPTER LX.,6.5715,2.4582882,45
8398,"There was a wreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with desk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow-window opening on to the lawn.",CHAPTER LX.,6.6279216,2.5033453,55
8399,"“Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts.",CHAPTER LX.,4.015244,4.148186,17
8400,"But Mrs. Bulstrode had particularly wished to have a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,” attributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the “Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr. Ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the value of this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite banker, “attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.”  This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he had been in a mood to care about such satire.",CHAPTER LX.,4.8958774,3.8583326,128
8401,"It referred to an understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper, that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had been training; since he wished finally to quit Middlemarch.",CHAPTER LX.,6.354361,2.5253484,46
8402,But indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary.,CHAPTER LX.,8.759512,2.9688199,41

8405,What was the use of going to London at that time of the year?,CHAPTER LX.,6.871002,4.479916,14
8406,"The Rugby men who would remember him were not there; and so far as political writing was concerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the “Pioneer.” At the present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him, he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not to go till he had once more seen Dorothea.",CHAPTER LX.,8.042021,-3.3885589,65
8407,"Hence he replied that he had reasons for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go to the sale.",CHAPTER LX.,7.3325644,3.8568733,22
8408,"Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property.",CHAPTER LX.,8.489478,2.1555822,47
8409,"Like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction, he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion—that there was anything in his blood, his bearing, or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion.",CHAPTER LX.,7.7844367,2.5952501,56
8410,"When he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive, watching for something which he had to dart upon.",CHAPTER LX.,8.31778,1.9343513,44
8411,"This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast.",CHAPTER LX.,8.223101,2.1028953,34
8412,"He was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him as an adventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante—who sneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing.",CHAPTER LX.,7.40696,2.3787904,57
8413,"He stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoissure by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties.",CHAPTER LX.,6.790267,2.7199485,50
8414,"And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge.",CHAPTER LX.,6.925664,2.7805636,34
8415,"Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to “Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins; he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation.",CHAPTER LX.,6.75647,2.7254264,60
8416,Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him.,CHAPTER LX.,6.3602533,2.163931,9
8417,"When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s enthusiasm, which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise.",CHAPTER LX.,5.6446743,-0.034872584,42
8418,"The fender was of polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.",CHAPTER LX.,6.741202,4.6531577,14

8420,"Here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of thing”—here Mr. Trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal, trimming his outlines with his left finger—“that might not fall in with ordinary tastes.",CHAPTER LX.,6.77666,4.530914,56
8421,"Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue—half-a-crown, you said?",CHAPTER LX.,6.97045,4.6496267,20

8425,"Four shillings, Mr. Mawmsey?—four shillings.”  “It’s not a thing I would put in my drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey, audibly, for the warning of the rash husband.",CHAPTER LX.,5.6739087,2.8573065,26
8426,“I wonder at Mrs. Larcher.,CHAPTER LX.,5.5435185,2.1385372,5
8427,Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut in two.,CHAPTER LX.,7.765986,5.095113,13
8428,"The edge is like a knife.”  “Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather shoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand: many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down.",CHAPTER LX.,6.7322707,4.7623653,60

8615,"“Thou knowest,”—the young Bulstrode had said then, as the older Bulstrode was saying now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul sits from these things—how I view them all as implements for tilling Thy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.”  Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his position seem a service demanded of him: the vista of a fortune had already opened itself, and Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private.",CHAPTER LXI.,3.9677677,4.4258037,81
8616,Mr. Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he had never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of salvation.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.6843667,3.1709452,28

8618,"Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same pleas—indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his soul had become more saturated with the belief that he did everything for God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his own.",CHAPTER LXI.,3.9726071,4.42765,62

8633,"But for himself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact was broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.030194,2.841908,33
8634,"Bulstrode’s course up to that time had, he thought, been sanctioned by remarkable providences, appearing to point the way for him to be the agent in making the best use of a large property and withdrawing it from perversion.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.1880217,4.549089,39
8635,"Death and other striking dispositions, such as feminine trustfulness, had come; and Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do you call these bare events?",CHAPTER LXI.,4.558064,4.0361013,23
8636,"The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively small, but the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor of his own ends.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.409784,2.4094288,24
8637,It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to others by inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.850563,2.9702845,24
8638,"Could it be for God’s service that this fortune should in any considerable proportion go to a young woman and her husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits, and might scatter it abroad in triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path of remarkable providences?",CHAPTER LXI.,9.87409,2.5452406,47
8639,"Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The daughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept her existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the mother with consolation in the probability that the unhappy young woman might be no more.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.0362816,4.00127,45
8640,There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his action was unrighteous; but how could he go back?,CHAPTER LXI.,4.1276236,4.4225144,18
8641,"He had mental exercises, called himself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his course of instrumentality.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.7059503,2.9347012,19
8642,"And after five years Death again came to widen his path, by taking away his wife.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.469761,2.5946622,16
8643,"He did gradually withdraw his capital, but he did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it finally collapsed.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.4586773,3.4192798,33
8644,"Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred thousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important—a banker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in trading concerns, in which his ability was directed to economy in the raw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy’s silk.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.796115,4.255427,52
8645,"And now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly thirty years—when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the consciousness—that past had risen and immersed his thought as if with the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.456161,2.1409824,44
8646,"Meanwhile, in his conversation with Raffles, he had learned something momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his longings and terrors.",CHAPTER LXI.,5.1501174,5.151515,23
8647,"There, he thought, lay an opening towards spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.959093,2.8338351,12
8648,The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.8780875,2.6496134,11
8649,"There may be coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.1102414,4.245744,25
8650,"He was simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.804586,2.934426,30
8651,"If this be hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all, to whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future perfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the world; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved remnant, including ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the solidarity of mankind.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.405999,3.270735,68
8652,The service he could do to the cause of religion had been through life the ground he alleged to himself for his choice of action: it had been the motive which he had poured out in his prayers.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.6922746,3.1223845,38
8653,Who would use money and position better than he meant to use them?,CHAPTER LXI.,7.4363995,4.8545384,13
8654,Who could surpass him in self-abhorrence and exaltation of God’s cause?,CHAPTER LXI.,7.899879,2.9624155,11
8655,"And to Mr. Bulstrode God’s cause was something distinct from his own rectitude of conduct: it enforced a discrimination of God’s enemies, who were to be used merely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep out of money and consequent influence.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.0583177,4.3775153,47
8656,"Also, profitable investments in trades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits in the hands of God’s servant.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.198155,4.025447,34
8657,This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to Englishmen.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.106144,3.841605,24
8658,There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.,CHAPTER LXI.,8.412651,3.432556,26
8659,"But a man who believes in something else than his own greed, has necessarily a conscience or standard to which he more or less adapts himself.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.214982,3.2309015,26
8660,Bulstrode’s standard had been his serviceableness to God’s cause: “I am sinful and nought—a vessel to be consecrated by use—but use me!”—had been the mould into which he had constrained his immense need of being something important and predominating.,CHAPTER LXI.,4.0507936,4.440459,39
8661,And now had come a moment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and utterly cast away.,CHAPTER LXI.,8.166173,2.2204409,20
8662,"What if the acts he had reconciled himself to because they made him a stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory?",CHAPTER LXI.,7.9997373,2.8522978,34
8663,"If this were to be the ruling of Providence, he was cast out from the temple as one who had brought unclean offerings.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.4642878,2.491228,23
8664,He had long poured out utterances of repentance.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.911987,2.8883586,8
8665,"But today a repentance had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening Providence urged him to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a doctrinal transaction.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.444579,2.471495,30
8666,"The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for him; self-prostration was no longer enough, and he must bring restitution in his hand.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.090644,2.8072858,22
8667,"It was really before his God that Bulstrode was about to attempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread had seized his susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame wrought in him a new spiritual need.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.040551,4.439076,38
8668,"Night and day, while the resurgent threatening past was making a conscience within him, he was thinking by what means he could recover peace and trust—by what sacrifice he could stay the rod.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.125218,2.3873584,33
8669,"His belief in these moments of dread was, that if he spontaneously did something right, God would save him from the consequences of wrong-doing.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.120159,2.5842478,24
8670,For religion can only change when the emotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal fear remains nearly at the level of the savage.,CHAPTER LXI.,7.960153,3.1599596,27
8671,"He had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this was a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread, but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win protection.",CHAPTER LXI.,5.10486,5.15043,41
8672,"At last he came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter to Will Ladislaw, begging him to be at the Shrubs that evening for a private interview at nine o’clock.",CHAPTER LXI.,5.684562,0.19780537,31
8673,"Will had felt no particular surprise at the request, and connected it with some new notions about the “Pioneer;” but when he was shown into Mr. Bulstrode’s private room, he was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was going to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness, he only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her satisfaction with the picture bought for her.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.8424373,3.9116285,70
8674,"“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters this evening.",CHAPTER LXI.,10.886423,2.8805735,15

8676,"Nothing, I dare say, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.”  Will felt something like an electric shock.",CHAPTER LXI.,9.221171,3.3917303,34
8677,"He was already in a state of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of ties in the past, and his presentiments were not agreeable.",CHAPTER LXI.,7.8638754,2.953285,27
8678,"It seemed like the fluctuations of a dream—as if the action begun by that loud bloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking piece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as their remembered contrast.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.523429,2.0476308,50
8679,"He answered, with a marked change of color—  “No, indeed, nothing.”  “You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken.",CHAPTER LXI.,5.851051,-0.16330673,23
8680,"But for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come here to-night.",CHAPTER LXI.,8.621709,5.2676077,45

8685,"May I ask if you can confirm these statements?”  “Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to the banker’s previous hints.",CHAPTER LXI.,5.44124,1.804058,39
8686,"But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed the order of his emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity for restitution had come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards the penitential expression by which he was deprecating chastisement.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.2436075,4.3860555,38
8687,“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.,CHAPTER LXI.,10.731219,3.6041,11
8688,“No; she never liked to speak of them.,CHAPTER LXI.,10.364886,3.3568275,8

8703,"Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode, who at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now raised them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—  “I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she might have been found.”  Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands.",CHAPTER LXI.,4.249051,4.0427856,64

8753,"In consequence of a letter from her uncle announcing his intention to be at home in a week, she had driven first to Freshitt to carry the news, meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which her uncle had intrusted her—thinking, as he said, “a little mental occupation of this sort good for a widow.”  If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that morning, he would have felt all his suppositions confirmed as to the readiness of certain people to sneer at his lingering in the neighborhood.",CHAPTER LXII.,6.7703686,-0.38704035,97

8755,"That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch nearly two months after he had declared that he was going immediately, was a fact to embitter Sir James’s suspicions, or at least to justify his aversion to a “young fellow” whom he represented to himself as slight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as naturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a strict profession.",CHAPTER LXII.,5.8403893,-0.21118143,67

8759,"He could not use Celia as a medium, because he did not choose that she should know the kind of gossip he had in his mind; and before Dorothea happened to arrive he had been trying to imagine how, with his shyness and unready tongue, he could ever manage to introduce his communication.",CHAPTER LXII.,9.006235,-2.3665102,53
8760,"Her unexpected presence brought him to utter hopelessness in his own power of saying anything unpleasant; but desperation suggested a resource; he sent the groom on an unsaddled horse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who already knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to repeat it as often as required.",CHAPTER LXII.,8.901318,-1.349141,59

8778,"I will not hear any evil spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he has already suffered too much injustice.”  Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her feelings; and even if she had been able to reflect, she would have held it petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of being herself misunderstood.",CHAPTER LXII.,7.5758953,-2.479872,59

8919,"“He may have been taking an opiate,” was a thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother’s mind—“tic-douloureux perhaps—or medical worries.”  It did not occur to him that Lydgate’s marriage was not delightful: he believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile creature, though he had always thought her rather uninteresting—a little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his mother could not forgive Rosamond because she never seemed to see that Henrietta Noble was in the room.",CHAPTER LXIII.,5.6784544,1.271966,79
8920,"“However, Lydgate fell in love with her,” said the Vicar to himself, “and she must be to his taste.”  Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his private affairs.",CHAPTER LXIII.,4.966029,2.4190876,80

8922,"The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy’s, where, on New Year’s Day, there was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the plea that he must not forsake his old friends on the first new year of his being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar.",CHAPTER LXIII.,6.46009,3.0012336,50

9156,"Lydgate had told her that this politeness meant nothing; but she was secretly convinced that any backwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him was due to his cold and contemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters in her most charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation would follow.",CHAPTER LXIV.,4.8070707,1.4488986,50

9159,"However, the season was come for thinking of friends at home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the chin, and pronounced her to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly, who had made a conquest of him in 1790, would be touched by any appeal from her, and would find it pleasant for her sake to behave as he ought to do towards his nephew.",CHAPTER LXIV.,5.4467874,1.163704,70
9160,Rosamond was naively convinced of what an old gentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering annoyance.,CHAPTER LXIV.,6.6474094,1.1186463,18
9161,"And she wrote what she considered the most judicious letter possible—one which would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent sense—pointing out how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place as Middlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant character of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and how in consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would require a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him.",CHAPTER LXIV.,6.428104,0.49017328,77
9162,She did not say that Tertius was unaware of her intention to write; for she had the idea that his supposed sanction of her letter would be in accordance with what she did say of his great regard for his uncle Godwin as the relative who had always been his best friend.,CHAPTER LXIV.,6.456822,0.4720491,52

9166,"Feeling it necessary that she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to speak to her again on the subject, and when they were breakfasting said—  “I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise the house in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were advertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not otherwise have thought of a change.",CHAPTER LXIV.,9.199141,0.09323147,81

9176,"The effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her shrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in the conviction that she was not the person to misbehave whatever others might do.",CHAPTER LXIV.,6.421072,1.0565649,41
9177,"She replied—  “I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me at least as much as you.”  “Clearly—you had a right to speak, but only to me.",CHAPTER LXIV.,10.622405,2.9668794,33

9186,"Rosamond, seeing that he was not looking at her, rose and set his cup of coffee before him; but he took no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument, occasionally moving in his seat, resting one arm on the table, and rubbing his hand against his hair.",CHAPTER LXIV.,6.8288126,1.1826183,52

9191,"If we are to live in that way let us at least leave Middlemarch.”  “These would be very strong considerations,” said Lydgate, half ironically—still there was a withered paleness about his lips as he looked at his coffee, and did not drink—“these would be very strong considerations if I did not happen to be in debt.”  “Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are respectable, people trust them.",CHAPTER LXIV.,7.2187214,4.9140577,75

9195,"But he not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on their mutual life—he had a growing dread of Rosamond’s quiet elusive obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final; and again, she had touched him in a spot of keenest feeling by implying that she had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying him.",CHAPTER LXIV.,6.7922716,1.3190591,62

9212,"There was another presence which ever since the early days of her marriage, until four months ago, had been an agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not confess to herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her utter ennui; and it seemed to her (perhaps she was right) that an invitation to Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle elsewhere than in Middlemarch—in London, or somewhere likely to be free from unpleasantness—would satisfy her quite well, and make her indifferent to the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she felt some resentment for his exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon.",CHAPTER LXIV.,5.81695,0.98464495,104

9214,"His flushed effort while talking to Mr. Farebrother—his effort after the cynical pretence that all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that chance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool’s illusion—was but the symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old stimuli of enthusiasm.",CHAPTER LXIV.,6.3925586,3.609313,52

9348,"Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool fresh hand to the cue.",CHAPTER LXVI.,5.992785,4.40821,13
9349,"But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and astonished to see him betting with an excited air, stood aside, and kept out of the circle round the table.",CHAPTER LXVI.,5.0021534,2.2451048,28
9350,Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late.,CHAPTER LXVI.,11.96776,5.299868,11
9351,"He had been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth’s under the eyes of Mary.",CHAPTER LXVI.,12.033739,4.10557,55
9352,"But the last fortnight Mary had been staying at Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother’s residence in Middlemarch, where he was carrying out some parochial plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general, considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct.",CHAPTER LXVI.,5.966501,4.611697,75
9353,"He had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him.",CHAPTER LXVI.,12.026249,4.171534,43
9354,"It was a little too bad, Fred began to think, that he should be kept in the traces with more severity than if he had been a clergyman.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.644816,5.0608954,28
9355,"“I will tell you what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work to learn surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,” he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her sake; “and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.215493,3.6722713,51
9356,"They had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.” And now, Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other strong dog who cannot slip his collar, had pulled up the staple of his chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.769721,4.719474,56
9357,"There could be no reason why he should not play at billiards, but he was determined not to bet.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.0365305,4.3821993,19
9358,"As to money just now, Fred had in his mind the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr. Garth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving up all futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of clothes, and no expense in his board.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.763883,5.485683,54
9359,"In that way he could, in one year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he had deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she needed that sum more than she did now.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.759568,5.384682,38
9360,"Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this evening, which was the fifth of his recent visits to the billiard-room, Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds which he meant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having before him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely to be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund from which he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good bet.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.7231007,5.418954,89
9361,Why?,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.897286,6.4632106,1
9362,"Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he catch a few?",CHAPTER LXVI.,7.3143487,2.886818,12
9363,"He would never go far along that road again; but a man likes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he could do in the way of mischief if he chose, and that if he abstains from making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is not because he is a spooney.",CHAPTER LXVI.,7.961057,2.9695857,68
9364,"Fred did not enter into formal reasons, which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was lurking in him a prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to play he should also begin to bet—that he should enjoy some punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling “rather seedy” in the morning.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.893065,5.4777,68
9365,It is in such indefinable movements that action often begins.,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.561359,3.6776903,10
9366,"But the last thing likely to have entered Fred’s expectation was that he should see his brother-in-law Lydgate—of whom he had never quite dropped the old opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious of his superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself might have done.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.948914,2.1077013,48
9367,"Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his father had refused to help him; and his own inclination to enter into the play was suddenly checked.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.634992,5.6753297,41
9368,"It was a strange reversal of attitudes: Fred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement, looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal with fierce eyes and retractile claws.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.8570094,1.8941848,88
9369,"Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but young Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.8314624,2.310114,21
9370,"He made first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes, the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in his own movements to defying another person’s doubt in them.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.8453937,2.1824777,34
9371,"The defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.",CHAPTER LXVI.,8.145375,2.858753,13
9372,"He continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.4778275,3.2492046,13
9373,"Still he went on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous crevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there.",CHAPTER LXVI.,7.9133697,2.4772444,27
9374,"Fred observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new situation of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which, without being offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and perhaps suggest to him a reason for quitting the room.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.780117,1.9966506,44
9375,"He saw that others were observing Lydgate’s strange unlikeness to himself, and it occurred to him that merely to touch his elbow and call him aside for a moment might rouse him from his absorption.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.887514,1.925255,35
9376,"He could think of nothing cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he wanted to see Rosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he was going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up to him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and begged to speak with him.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.5418634,3.7245643,62
9377,"Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he would be down immediately, he went with a new impulse up to Lydgate, said, “Can I speak to you a moment?” and drew him aside.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.5662613,1.7588949,36

9379,He is below.,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.750841,3.9367058,3
9380,"I thought you might like to know he was there, if you had anything to say to him.”  Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he could not say, “You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare at you; you had better come away.” But inspiration could hardly have served him better.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.770786,5.2675657,56
9381,"Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present, and his sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had the effect of a sharp concussion.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.9711313,2.374876,26
9382,"“No, no,” said Lydgate; “I have nothing particular to say to him.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.357392,1.7527909,12
9383,"But—the game is up—I must be going—I came in just to see Bambridge.”  “Bambridge is over there, but he is making a row—I don’t think he’s ready for business.",CHAPTER LXVI.,5.917158,4.880118,29
9384,Come down with me to Farebrother.,CHAPTER LXVI.,6.356315,3.7085881,6

9386,"Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he felt it, by refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he went down.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.9924445,2.3531504,24
9387,"They merely shook hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to Lydgate.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.975019,2.5461776,29
9388,"His present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and he said, kindly, “I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some pressing business with you.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.682026,5.277018,27
9389,"Walk with me to St. Botolph’s, will you?”  It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the London road.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.422464,3.7214358,36
9390,"The next thing he said was—  “I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?”  “So did I,” said Fred.",CHAPTER LXVI.,4.521885,1.7484615,20
9391,"“But he said that he went to see Bambridge.”  “He was not playing, then?”  Fred had not meant to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, “Yes, he was.",CHAPTER LXVI.,5.940869,4.9123783,31
9392,But I suppose it was an accidental thing.,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.443848,5.5188437,8

9394,"You know all about it,” said Fred, not liking to be catechised in this way.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.756905,5.268562,15
9395,“I made a clean breast to you.”  “I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now.,CHAPTER LXVI.,10.213931,4.517086,20

9397,"I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?”  “I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, in a state of uncomfortable surmise.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.202649,4.71948,29
9398,“I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.969561,4.665349,14
9399,"But I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.77134,5.1154494,25
9400,"When somebody said to me, ‘Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every night again—he won’t bear the curb long;’ I was tempted to do the opposite of what I am doing—to hold my tongue and wait while you went down the ladder again, betting first and then—”  “I have not made any bets,” said Fred, hastily.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.056681,4.3787136,59
9401,“Glad to hear it.,CHAPTER LXVI.,9.5684185,5.392724,4

9404,I am sure you know that the satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.”  There was a pause.,CHAPTER LXVI.,10.220882,3.7721605,21
9405,Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his fine voice gave solemnity to his words.,CHAPTER LXVI.,6.501369,3.331063,27

9410,"I can easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she feels towards you—it must be remembered that she is only conditionally bound to you—and that in that case, another man, who may flatter himself that he has a hold on her regard, might succeed in winning that firm place in her love as well as respect which you had let slip.",CHAPTER LXVI.,10.349743,2.614691,67
9411,"I can easily conceive such a result,” repeated Mr. Farebrother, emphatically.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.4770656,3.6690178,11
9412,"“There is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might get the advantage even over the longest associations.” It seemed to Fred that if Mr. Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his very capable tongue, his mode of attack could hardly be more cruel.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.621688,4.79149,46
9413,He had a horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement there was a knowledge of some actual change in Mary’s feeling.,CHAPTER LXVI.,11.459541,3.2678978,22
9414,"“Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,” he said, in a troubled voice.",CHAPTER LXVI.,9.996058,4.3699846,18

9419,"If there’s a chance of his going to the dogs, let him—perhaps you could nohow hinder it—and do you take the benefit.’”  There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable chill.",CHAPTER LXVI.,11.798731,5.200199,36
9420,What was coming next?,CHAPTER LXVI.,8.373304,5.42718,4

9422,When the Vicar began again there was a change in his tone like the encouraging transition to a major key.,CHAPTER LXVI.,6.084519,4.1838417,20

9425,"And now, do you understand me?",CHAPTER LXVI.,9.176151,5.1964626,6
9426,"I want you to make the happiness of her life and your own, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn aside any risk to the contrary—well, I have uttered it.”  There was a drop in the Vicar’s voice when he spoke the last words.",CHAPTER LXVI.,6.197448,4.178683,52
9427,"He paused—they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged towards St. Botolph’s, and he put out his hand, as if to imply that the conversation was closed.",CHAPTER LXVI.,9.059833,1.139011,31

9444,"Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to gamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to the needful amount, he would have liked to gamble, rather than take the alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.",CHAPTER LXVII.,7.0407333,3.1377184,41
9445,That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode.,CHAPTER LXVII.,4.2921824,4.366749,8

9469,"He wanted to consult Lydgate without delay on that particular morning, although he had nothing to tell beyond what he had told before.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.6986156,2.548777,23
9470,"He listened eagerly to what Lydgate had to say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only repetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical opinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a personal need to him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation beforehand.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.5854006,3.2939076,56
9471,He had been insisting that it would be well for Mr. Bulstrode to relax his attention to business.,CHAPTER LXVII.,4.41106,4.4278927,18
9472,"“One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate frame,” said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks tend to pass from the personal to the general, “by the deep stamp which anxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous.",CHAPTER LXVII.,8.494705,2.8968883,50

9475,"“You have at all events taken your share in using good practical precautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for protection,” said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the banker’s religion, somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.9323335,2.1117997,52

9481,"That would be a measure which you would recommend?”  “Oh yes,” said Lydgate, falling backward in his chair, with ill-repressed impatience under the banker’s pale earnest eyes and intense preoccupation with himself.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.485531,1.8473972,32

9484,"I shall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch, consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of building it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful working.”  Lydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was, “He has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most plausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling change in his expectations.",CHAPTER LXVII.,5.047144,3.2957785,88
9485,"He said in reply—  “The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”  “Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone; “except by some changes of plan.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.5181866,3.8567371,31
9486,The only person who may be certainly counted on as willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon.,CHAPTER LXVII.,8.404901,-0.43811956,18
9487,"I have had an interview with her on the subject, and I have pointed out to her, as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a more general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.” Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.",CHAPTER LXVII.,5.2151074,2.9833398,52

9490,In this way any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new establishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town will cease to be divided.”  Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his eyes from Lydgate’s face to the buttons of his coat as he again paused.,CHAPTER LXVII.,4.674234,3.4409878,47

9492,"“But I can’t be expected to rejoice in it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other medical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because they are mine.”  “I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of new and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the original plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under submission to the Divine Will.",CHAPTER LXVII.,5.684344,3.2283638,78
9493,"But since providential indications demand a renunciation from me, I renounce.”  Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.",CHAPTER LXVII.,4.307063,4.237796,20
9494,The broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his hearer’s contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the facts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his own indignation and disappointment.,CHAPTER LXVII.,4.8107862,2.046823,37
9495,"After some rapid reflection, he only asked—  “What did Mrs. Casaubon say?”  “That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,” said Bulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his ministerial explanation.",CHAPTER LXVII.,8.191583,-0.4758603,33

9573,"Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of uneasy presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided any allusion to it.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.1299896,4.0674057,26
9574,"He had been used every day to taste the flavor of supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that he was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his having some discreditable secret, made his voice totter when he was speaking to edification.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.792494,2.593269,47
9575,"Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious temperament, is often worse than seeing; and his imagination continually heightened the anguish of an imminent disgrace.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.1130576,4.336937,23
9576,"Yes, imminent; for if his defiance of Raffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this result he hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,5.0985866,5.0839477,28
9577,"In vain he said to himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a chastisement, a preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and he judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he should escape dishonor.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,8.187565,2.5910733,42
9578,That recoil had at last urged him to make preparations for quitting Middlemarch.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,6.797551,2.1677308,13
9579,"If evil truth must be reported of him, he would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt of his old neighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not have gathered the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him, would be less formidable.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,8.150866,2.8796644,50
9580,"To leave the place finally would, he knew, be extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have preferred to stay where he had struck root.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.301614,2.2506082,29
9581,"Hence he made his preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all sides an opening for his return after brief absence, if any favorable intervention of Providence should dissipate his fears.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.5385065,2.43359,35
9582,"He was preparing to transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up any active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the ground of his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of such work.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.4525204,3.6599483,40
9583,The measure would cause him some added expense and some diminution of income beyond what he had already undergone from the general depression of trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a principal object of outlay on which he could fairly economize.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,6.9254174,3.2352633,42
9584,This was the experience which had determined his conversation with Lydgate.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.521217,2.0971668,11
9585,But at this time his arrangements had most of them gone no farther than a stage at which he could recall them if they proved to be unnecessary.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.3793406,2.6983309,28
9586,"He continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of his fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his wife for the project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she would like to live.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.7557044,2.396342,85
9587,"Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the farm at Stone Court in case of his absence; and on this as well as on all other matters connected with any houses and land he possessed in or about Middlemarch, he had consulted Caleb Garth.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.8610086,4.2577624,49
9588,"Like every one else who had business of that sort, he wanted to get the agent who was more anxious for his employer’s interests than his own.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.166601,3.3368604,27
9589,"With regard to Stone Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain his hold on the stock, and to have an arrangement by which he himself could, if he chose, resume his favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised him not to trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and implements yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.9346914,4.338862,62
9590,"“May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?” said Bulstrode.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.5157633,4.1482873,17

9592,"“I’ll see how I can make it out.”  If it had not been that he had to consider Fred Vincy’s future, Mr. Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his work, of which his wife was always fearing an excess for him as he grew older.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,11.61874,4.618803,50
9593,"But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea occurred to him about this said letting of Stone Court.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.848432,4.3519797,21
9594,"What if Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy there on the understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the management?",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.6526613,4.1971345,24
9595,"It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by helping in other business.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.7311697,3.9732985,28
9596,He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with such evident delight that she could not bear to chill his pleasure by expressing her constant fear of his undertaking too much.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,12.0394745,4.102995,30
9597,"“The lad would be as happy as two,” he said, throwing himself back in his chair, and looking radiant, “if I could tell him it was all settled.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,10.371787,3.8782682,28
9598,Think; Susan!,CHAPTER LXVIII.,11.387697,3.5382645,2
9599,His mind had been running on that place for years before old Featherstone died.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,10.741413,5.617677,14
9600,And it would be as pretty a turn of things as could be that he should hold the place in a good industrious way after all—by his taking to business.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,7.633811,3.7968123,30
9601,"For it’s likely enough Bulstrode might let him go on, and gradually buy the stock.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.272153,4.5119386,15
9602,"He hasn’t made up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall settle somewhere else as a lasting thing.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,8.220644,3.9452689,21
9603,I never was better pleased with a notion in my life.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,8.72014,4.412672,11
9604,"And then the children might be married by-and-by, Susan.”  “You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?” said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of gentle caution.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.262846,3.796581,40
9605,"“And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not help to hasten it.”  “Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,12.077516,6.537282,24
9606,“Marriage is a taming thing.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,10.198401,3.0481405,5

9609,I shall speak to Bulstrode again.”  He took his earliest opportunity of doing so.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.387523,4.359511,14
9610,"Bulstrode had anything but a warm interest in his nephew Fred Vincy, but he had a strong wish to secure Mr. Garth’s services on many scattered points of business at which he was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less conscientious management.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.5804315,4.174591,46
9611,On that ground he made no objection to Mr. Garth’s proposal; and there was also another reason why he was not sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,12.140281,4.2194705,35
9612,"It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate’s debts, had been anxious to know whether her husband could not do something for poor Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that Lydgate’s affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan was to let them “take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for the first time, “I think you are always a little hard towards my family, Nicholas.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,5.7298646,1.6004472,74
9613,And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my relatives.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,9.632697,3.996269,14
9614,"Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that they were not respectable.”  “My dear Harriet,” said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his wife’s eyes, which were filling with tears, “I have supplied your brother with a great deal of capital.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.2583065,3.6240184,44
9615,"I cannot be expected to take care of his married children.”  That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she had always foreseen the fruits of.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,6.140039,1.4264545,36
9616,"But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he had to talk to his wife fully about his plan of quitting Middlemarch, he should be glad to tell her that he had made an arrangement which might be for the good of her nephew Fred.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.2977843,3.86328,46
9617,"At present he had merely mentioned to her that he thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and taking a house on the Southern Coast.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,9.377704,0.56959295,28
9618,"Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he desired, namely, that in case of Bulstrode’s departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms proposed.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,4.837647,4.25321,37
9619,"Caleb was so elated with his hope of this “neat turn” being given to things, that if his self-control had not been braced by a little affectionate wifely scolding, he would have betrayed everything to Mary, wanting “to give the child comfort.” However, he restrained himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate.",CHAPTER LXVIII.,11.92292,6.629257,81
9620,He was certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events required him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in occupying his mind with this bit of probable happiness which he held in store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,8.209398,2.3202503,50
9621,“But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the air?” said Mrs. Garth.,CHAPTER LXVIII.,11.88352,4.291652,18

9624,"Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his manager’s room at the Bank, about three o’clock of the same day on which he had received Lydgate there, when the clerk entered to say that his horse was waiting, and also that Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.7648644,3.7974246,50
9625,"“By all means,” said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.954227,6.6353164,8

9628,"I know you count your minutes.”  “Oh,” said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as he seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.158996,6.5574503,31
9629,"He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers droop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.697405,1.5473126,35
9630,"Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be important, and rather expected that he was about to recur to the buying of some houses in Blindman’s Court, for the sake of pulling them down, as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of air and light on that spot.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.763545,4.302207,72
9631,"It was by propositions of this kind that Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his employers; but he had usually found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of improvement, and they had got on well together.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.749812,6.8152986,36
9632,"When he spoke again, however, it was to say, in rather a subdued voice—  “I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”  “You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there myself yesterday.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.9186983,4.3321357,39
9633,"Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”  “Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a stranger, who is very ill, I think.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.969525,6.6222153,27
9634,"He wants a doctor, and I came to tell you of that.",CHAPTER LXIX.,6.0268097,3.4023938,12
9635,His name is Raffles.”  He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame.,CHAPTER LXIX.,4.8506274,4.9632487,15
9636,On this subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly on the watch to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.1976757,3.0344017,26
9637,"“Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips trembled a little.",CHAPTER LXIX.,10.655928,3.833153,14
9638,"“Do you know how he came there?”  “I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.041268,6.528294,19
9639,"He had got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning from the toll-house, and I overtook him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,7.1064143,1.9467671,22
9640,"He remembered seeing me with you once before, at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.508992,4.378375,19
9641,"I saw he was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry him under shelter.",CHAPTER LXIX.,7.7157764,2.501886,19
9642,"And now I think you should lose no time in getting advice for him.” Caleb took up his hat from the floor as he ended, and rose slowly from his seat.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.068021,6.5360394,31
9643,"“Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.2831187,4.2283297,11
9644,"“Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr. Lydgate’s as you pass—or stay!",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.145954,4.0452375,17

9646,"I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this instant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.”  Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the commission to his man.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.966223,4.291437,40
9647,"When he returned, Caleb was standing as before with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his hat with the other.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.065833,6.5646753,23
9648,"In Bulstrode’s mind the dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only spoke to Garth of his illness.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.8047285,4.8421,16
9649,"Garth may wonder, as he must have done before, at this disreputable fellow’s claiming intimacy with me; but he will know nothing.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.216878,4.1562395,22
9650,"And he is friendly to me—I can be of use to him.”  He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been to betray fear.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.1246214,5.161617,41
9651,"“I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual tone of politeness.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.9715185,4.317392,16
9652,"“My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I shall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.701488,3.8489249,25
9653,Perhaps you had some other business with me?,CHAPTER LXIX.,8.046062,5.1919403,8
9654,"If so, pray be seated.”  “Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to waive the invitation.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.041303,6.599382,21

9659,"“It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.15093,6.5524793,9
9660,"I must give it up.”  He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking dried and his eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.2147245,4.3319325,43

9697,"I wish you good-day.”  Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife, incidentally, that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode, and that in consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone Court, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.825611,6.7468176,50
9698,"“He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth, imagining that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and not been allowed to do what he thought right as to materials and modes of work.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.061448,4.1272707,40
9699,"“Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely.",CHAPTER LXIX.,12.066361,6.5821266,11
9700,And Mrs. Garth knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further on the subject.,CHAPTER LXIX.,12.110017,4.1069603,19
9701,"As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.7553816,3.7585397,23
9702,"His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language to his hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which shake our whole system.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.317315,2.2558305,30
9703,"The deep humiliation with which he had winced under Caleb Garth’s knowledge of his past and rejection of his patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety in the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles had spoken.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.0259485,4.8716245,48
9704,It seemed to him a sort of earnest that Providence intended his rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left open for the hope of secrecy.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.4508257,2.4208813,27
9705,"That Raffles should be afflicted with illness, that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than elsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities which these events conjured up.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.8036857,4.8297224,31
9706,If it should turn out that he was freed from all danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his life should be more consecrated than it had ever been before.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.9567943,2.885479,31
9707,He mentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result he longed for—he tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful resolution—its potency to determine death.,CHAPTER LXIX.,8.171108,2.7998,30
9708,"He knew that he ought to say, “Thy will be done;” and he said it often.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.471439,2.994189,16
9709,But the intense desire remained that the will of God might be the death of that hated man.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.938341,2.8081408,18
9710,Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in Raffles without a shock.,CHAPTER LXIX.,5.099667,5.199137,18
9711,"But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode would have called the change in him entirely mental.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.098873,4.445503,16
9712,"Instead of his loud tormenting mood, he showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode’s anger, because the money was all gone—he had been robbed—it had half of it been taken from him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.4501767,4.3862658,35
9713,"He had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting him—somebody was after him, he had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth shut.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.056741,2.576321,28
9714,"Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not told anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought him to Stone Court.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.395789,4.5616913,55
9715,"Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him, and that his minute terror-stricken narrative to Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which had dropped back into darkness.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.0546613,5.057775,42
9716,"Bulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp over the wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be trusted as to the fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or not he had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except Caleb Garth.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.724126,4.4887,55
9717,"The housekeeper had told him without the least constraint of manner that since Mr. Garth left, Raffles had asked her for beer, and after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side it might be concluded that there had been no betrayal.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.1182256,5.002061,44
9718,"Mrs. Abel thought, like the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the unpleasant “kin” who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property left, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural enough.",CHAPTER LXIX.,11.850448,2.3009462,52
9719,"How he could be “kin” to Bulstrode as well was not so clear, but Mrs. Abel agreed with her husband that there was “no knowing,” a proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her, so that she shook her head over it without further speculation.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.1287313,3.9281383,48
9720,In less than an hour Lydgate arrived.,CHAPTER LXIX.,4.3606343,1.9880458,7
9721,"Bulstrode met him outside the wainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said—  “I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once in my employment, many years ago.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.7460046,4.3522067,32
9722,"Afterwards he went to America, and returned I fear to an idle dissolute life.",CHAPTER LXIX.,7.908445,2.3586495,14

9725,I believe he is seriously ill: apparently his mind is affected.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.5889907,2.519909,11
9726,"I feel bound to do the utmost for him.”  Lydgate, who had the remembrance of his last conversation with Bulstrode strongly upon him, was not disposed to say an unnecessary word to him, and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just before entering the room he turned automatically and said, “What is his name?”—to know names being as much a part of the medical man’s accomplishment as of the practical politician’s.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.908454,3.0300684,73
9727,"“Raffles, John Raffles,” said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became of Raffles, Lydgate would never know any more of him.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.743875,3.7870886,20
9728,"When he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate ordered that he should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete quiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.7235165,3.3046021,35

9749,"I shall come again to-morrow morning.”  After waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode, Lydgate rode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the history of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware’s abundant experience in America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic poisoning such as this.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.062121,4.438528,67
9750,"Lydgate, when abroad, had already been interested in this question: he was strongly convinced against the prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering large doses of opium; and he had repeatedly acted on this conviction with a favorable result.",CHAPTER LXIX.,4.855387,2.5176501,40

9755,"I suppose he has some test by which he finds out whom Heaven cares for—he has made up his mind that it doesn’t care for me.”  This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept widening in the current of his thought as he neared Lowick Gate.",CHAPTER LXIX.,8.338319,2.648129,49
9756,"He had not been there since his first interview with Bulstrode in the morning, having been found at the Hospital by the banker’s messenger; and for the first time he was returning to his home without the vision of any expedient in the background which left him a hope of raising money enough to deliver him from the coming destitution of everything which made his married life tolerable—everything which saved him and Rosamond from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to recognize how little of a comfort they could be to each other.",CHAPTER LXIX.,6.161542,1.5242937,96
9757,It was more bearable to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his own tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to her.,CHAPTER LXIX.,10.258657,2.0410037,29
9758,"The sufferings of his own pride from humiliations past and to come were keen enough, yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself from that more acute pain which dominated them—the pain of foreseeing that Rosamond would come to regard him chiefly as the cause of disappointment and unhappiness to her.",CHAPTER LXIX.,7.057535,1.4054517,50
9759,"He had never liked the makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his prospects for himself; but he was beginning now to imagine how two creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common, might laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far they could afford butter and eggs.",CHAPTER LXIX.,7.739605,2.3920488,58
9760,But the glimpse of that poetry seemed as far off from him as the carelessness of the golden age; in poor Rosamond’s mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look small in.,CHAPTER LXIX.,6.837116,1.1900247,34
9761,"He got down from his horse in a very sad mood, and went into the house, not expecting to be cheered except by his dinner, and reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell Rosamond of his application to Bulstrode and its failure.",CHAPTER LXIX.,6.210403,1.5248197,47
9762,It would be well not to lose time in preparing her for the worst.,CHAPTER LXIX.,10.873414,2.0258205,14

9768,The strong man had had too much to bear that day.,CHAPTER LXIX.,7.635976,2.899846,11
9769,He let his head fall beside hers and sobbed.,CHAPTER LXIX.,9.823445,1.6188512,9
9770,He did not hinder her from going to her father early in the morning—it seemed now that he ought not to hinder her from doing as she pleased.,CHAPTER LXIX.,10.858169,1.9947032,28

9777,"“I may get my neck broken, and that may make things easier to you.”  It was Lydgate’s misfortune and Rosamond’s too, that his tenderness towards her, which was both an emotional prompting and a well-considered resolve, was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts of indignation either ironical or remonstrant.",CHAPTER LXIX.,5.5253797,1.2415311,48
9778,"She thought them totally unwarranted, and the repulsion which this exceptional severity excited in her was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness unacceptable.",CHAPTER LXIX.,10.320589,1.8846673,25

9784," “Our deeds still travel with us from afar, And what we have been makes us what we are.”  Bulstrode’s first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to examine Raffles’s pockets, which he imagined were sure to carry signs in the shape of hotel-bills of the places he had stopped in, if he had not told the truth in saying that he had come straight from Liverpool because he was ill and had no money.",CHAPTER LXX.,4.688271,3.8288796,76
9785,"There were various bills crammed into his pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any other place, except one, which bore date that morning.",CHAPTER LXX.,7.133417,4.2304864,27
9786,"This was crumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his tail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days’ stay at an inn at Bilkley, where the fair was held—a town at least forty miles from Middlemarch.",CHAPTER LXX.,6.327718,5.23761,40
9787,"The bill was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with him, it seemed probable that he had left his portmanteau behind in payment, in order to save money for his travelling fare; for his purse was empty, and he had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence in his pockets.",CHAPTER LXX.,5.2504735,5.0395308,53
9788,Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his memorable visit at Christmas.,CHAPTER LXX.,4.741939,4.7993364,25

9790,And what harm if he did talk?,CHAPTER LXX.,8.873728,3.115997,7
9791,"The chief point now was to keep watch over him as long as there was any danger of that intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which seemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much anxiety lest some such impulse should come over him at the sight of Lydgate.",CHAPTER LXX.,4.628677,3.6231005,52
9792,"He sat up alone with him through the night, only ordering the housekeeper to lie down in her clothes, so as to be ready when he called her, alleging his own indisposition to sleep, and his anxiety to carry out the doctor’s orders.",CHAPTER LXX.,9.090175,1.4182935,43

9796,"Even this Bulstrode felt that he would not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of fitful alternation in his delirium was, that in-the morning twilight Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him and declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him to death out of revenge for telling, when he never had told.",CHAPTER LXX.,4.576877,3.7349524,59

9846,"You said, I think, that a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from your burthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?”  “Yes,” said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him surmounting every other feeling; “that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on hand.",CHAPTER LXX.,6.9565563,5.244707,52

9853,“You have restored to me the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.”  It appeared to him a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he should have reconsidered his refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent side of his character.,CHAPTER LXX.,4.2711616,4.334074,44
9854,"But as he put his hack into a canter, that he might get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get cash at the bank to pay over to Dover’s agent, there crossed his mind, with an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil augury across his vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which a few months had brought—that he should be overjoyed at being under a strong personal obligation—that he should be overjoyed at getting money for himself from Bulstrode.",CHAPTER LXX.,4.8251934,4.0423656,89

9862,"Lydgate’s opinion was not on the side of promise that this prayer would be fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt himself getting irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he would fain have seen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself, had no power.",CHAPTER LXX.,4.6620464,3.2540925,61

9953,"Whatever certain dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had given him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being more and more distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion of Lydgate’s having resources or friends in the background must be quite illusory.",CHAPTER LXX.,5.022186,2.3196702,64

10040,"In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an arbitration if it were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles.",CHAPTER LXXI.,5.09058,4.6224027,57

10046,"But while they were talking another combination was silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary “putting of two and two together.” With the reasons which kept Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread might have something to do with his munificence towards his medical man; and though he resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding that this complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s reputation.",CHAPTER LXXI.,4.6413383,3.650757,100

10056,Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of Bulstrode.,CHAPTER LXXI.,4.893794,3.7294211,26
10057,"But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not only to get rid of the execution in his house but to pay all his debts in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and comments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a significant relation between this sudden command of money and Bulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles.",CHAPTER LXXI.,4.6282086,3.4944353,81
10058,"That the money came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there had been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into the gossip about Lydgate’s affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor his own family would do anything for him, and direct evidence was furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs. Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who mentioned it generally.",CHAPTER LXXI.,4.5833306,3.34682,86

10060,For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at the bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate.,CHAPTER LXXI.,4.5678306,3.3824182,19
10061,"Mr. Hawley indeed, in the first instance, invited a select party, including the two physicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles’s illness, reciting to them all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in connection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due to delirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood undisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared that they could see nothing in these particulars which could be transformed into a positive ground of suspicion.",CHAPTER LXXI.,5.3383636,4.076599,96
10062,"But the moral grounds of suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for wishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment he had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time have known the need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode would be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe that Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when they have found themselves in want of money.",CHAPTER LXXI.,4.610942,3.6985934,83
10063,"Even if the money had been given merely to make him hold his tongue about the scandal of Bulstrode’s earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate, who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the banker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and discrediting the elder members of his profession.",CHAPTER LXXI.,4.63621,3.129157,58

10409,That would account for everything.,CHAPTER LXXIV.,8.726062,5.5075116,5

10412,Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she found to her surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered communication under other circumstances—there was the dislike of being pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her the superiority.,CHAPTER LXXIV.,4.12579,3.5257392,70
10413,"For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs. Plymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some kind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native directness, “What is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself anxious to get away before she had heard anything more explicit.",CHAPTER LXXIV.,4.144582,3.4027786,69
10414,"She began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune was something more than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive to the fact that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before, avoided noticing what she said about her husband, as they would have avoided noticing a personal blemish.",CHAPTER LXXIV.,4.0875854,3.5949554,52

10417,"Something of the same effect was produced in him by the sight of her: he rose from his seat to meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with his impulsive rashness—  “God help you, Harriet!",CHAPTER LXXIV.,11.531867,2.7164373,37

10420,"Without that memory of Raffles she might still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her brother’s look and words there darted into her mind the idea of some guilt in her husband—then, under the working of terror came the image of her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an instant of scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with one leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching fellowship with shame and isolation.",CHAPTER LXXIV.,9.78057,1.8428167,87

10469,"In this brief interval of calm, Lydgate, remembering that he had often been stormy in his hours of perturbation, and mindful of the pain Rosamond had had to bear, was carefully gentle towards her; but he, too, had lost some of his old spirit, and he still felt it necessary to refer to an economical change in their way of living as a matter of course, trying to reconcile her to it gradually, and repressing his anger when she answered by wishing that he would go to live in London.",CHAPTER LXXV.,5.4323454,1.308781,90

10473,"She had felt stung and disappointed by Will’s resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of what she knew and guessed about his admiration for Dorothea, she secretly cherished the belief that he had, or would necessarily come to have, much more admiration for herself; Rosamond being one of those women who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have preferred them if the preference had not been hopeless.",CHAPTER LXXV.,8.004328,-2.7376873,73

10479,"No notion could have been falser than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was due to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for self-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her husband; but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm which diverted her ennui.",CHAPTER LXXV.,6.5490127,1.1540635,53
10480,"She constructed a little romance which was to vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an understood though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.",CHAPTER LXXV.,5.7194495,-0.00950717,57

10485,"It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was nothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization, but mentioned incidentally, that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to Middlemarch within the next few weeks—a very pleasant necessity, he said, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy.",CHAPTER LXXV.,5.6781535,2.1511326,67

10492,"In the new gayety of her spirits, thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual, causing him to leave her remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible, she chose, a few days after the meeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this was a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse.",CHAPTER LXXV.,4.9087834,1.3604958,92

10654,"But the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.”  “Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you would gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you, because they would see that your purposes were pure.",CHAPTER LXXVI.,8.847846,-3.4042711,78

10763,"Even in her most uneasy moments—even when she had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader’s painfully graphic report of gossip—her effort, nay, her strongest impulsive prompting, had been towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when, in her meeting with him afterwards, she had at first interpreted his words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he was determined to cut himself off from indulging, she had had a quick, sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his constant opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely shared his other tastes as she evidently did his delight in music.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,8.657523,-1.254814,110

10777,"“Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker” was a phrase which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode business, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of placard on poor Will’s back than the “Italian with white mice.” Upright Sir James Chettam was convinced that his own satisfaction was righteous when he thought with some complacency that here was an added league to that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea, which enabled him to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too absurd.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,5.9038496,-0.33003077,90
10778,"And perhaps there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr. Brooke’s attention to this ugly bit of Ladislaw’s genealogy, as a fresh candle for him to see his own folly by.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,6.355974,-0.716327,31
10779,"Dorothea had observed the animus with which Will’s part in the painful story had been recalled more than once; but she had uttered no word, being checked now, as she had not been formerly in speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a deeper relation between them which must always remain in consecrated secrecy.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,8.330488,-3.210927,54
10780,"But her silence shrouded her resistant emotion into a more thorough glow; and this misfortune in Will’s lot which, it seemed, others were wishing to fling at his back as an opprobrium, only gave something more of enthusiasm to her clinging thought.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,9.854945,1.847253,42
10781,"She entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and yet she had taken no posture of renunciation.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,10.351984,1.417292,20
10782,"She had accepted her whole relation to Will very simply as part of her marriage sorrows, and would have thought it very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail because she was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on the superfluities of her lot.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,10.395064,1.6713294,48
10783,"She could bear that the chief pleasures of her tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came to her solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her friends, would be a source of torment to her:—“somebody who will manage your property for you, my dear,” was Mr. Brooke’s attractive suggestion of suitable characteristics.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,6.9283886,-1.4467467,70

10786,"This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in all her waking hours since she had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs. Lydgate, making a sort of background against which she saw Rosamond’s figure presented to her without hindrances to her interest and compassion.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,5.6493087,0.21899539,48
10787,"There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the husband who had yet made her happiness a law to him.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,10.623141,1.9561304,30
10788,That was a trouble which no third person must directly touch.,CHAPTER LXXVII.,10.273112,1.3529932,11

10792,"“I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps she will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.”  Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she had to get out of her carriage very near to Lydgate’s, she walked thither across the street, having told the coachman to wait for some packages.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,8.007838,-2.7150097,68

10800,"She found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything remarkable, but immediately she heard a voice speaking in low tones which startled her as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a bookcase, she saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which filled up all outlines, something which made her pause, motionless, without self-possession enough to speak.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,9.526196,1.0636263,74
10801,"Seated with his back towards her on a sofa which stood against the wall on a line with the door by which she had entered, she saw Will Ladislaw: close by him and turned towards him with a flushed tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her face sat Rosamond, her bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her clasped both her upraised hands in his and spoke with low-toned fervor.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,5.6800337,0.30579484,71
10802,"Rosamond in her agitated absorption had not noticed the silently advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her hands and rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,8.284197,-2.9721787,60
10803,"Will Ladislaw, starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea’s eyes with a new lightning in them, seemed changing to marble.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,7.7215347,-2.6327655,21

10805,"I called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished to put into your own hands.”  She laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and bow, she went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the surprised Martha, who said she was sorry the mistress was not at home, and then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that grand people were probably more impatient than others.",CHAPTER LXXVII.,5.3724713,1.1401993,90
10806,Dorothea walked across the street with her most elastic step and was quickly in her carriage again.,CHAPTER LXXVII.,8.772594,-2.9159439,17

11000,"“Yes, the check is going to Bulstrode to-day.”  He said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately finished dressing herself, and sat languidly wondering what she should do next, her habitual industry in small things, even in the days of her sadness, prompting her to begin some kind of occupation, which she dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.1856604,1.4292462,66
11001,"She looked ill, but had recovered her usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had feared to disturb her by any questions.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,4.871934,1.2420149,21

11003,I thought he looked rather battered and depressed.” And Rosamond had made no reply.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.72506,1.2657286,14
11004,"Now, when he came up, he said to her very gently, “Rosy, dear, Mrs. Casaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see her, would you not?” That she colored and gave rather a startled movement did not surprise him after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday—a beneficent agitation, he thought, since it seemed to have made her turn to him again.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.395568,-0.37523723,66

11009,"Nevertheless, in her new humiliating uncertainty she dared do nothing but comply.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.806029,1.5183649,12
11010,"She did not say yes, but she rose and let Lydgate put a light shawl over her shoulders, while he said, “I am going out immediately.” Then something crossed her mind which prompted her to say, “Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the drawing-room.” And Lydgate assented, thinking that he fully understood this wish.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,5.1094055,1.1646265,58
11011,"He led her down to the drawing-room door, and then turned away, observing to himself that he was rather a blundering husband to be dependent for his wife’s trust in him on the influence of another woman.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.106248,1.7527144,37
11012,"Rosamond, wrapping her soft shawl around her as she walked towards Dorothea, was inwardly wrapping her soul in cold reserve.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.246757,-2.9181943,20
11013,Had Mrs. Casaubon come to say anything to her about Will?,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.389394,-0.2847066,11
11014,"If so, it was a liberty that Rosamond resented; and she prepared herself to meet every word with polite impassibility.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.4979115,1.0703735,20
11015,Will had bruised her pride too sorely for her to feel any compunction towards him and Dorothea: her own injury seemed much the greater.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.31292,-3.3126478,24
11016,"Dorothea was not only the “preferred” woman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate’s benefactor; and to poor Rosamond’s pained confused vision it seemed that this Mrs. Casaubon—this woman who predominated in all things concerning her—must have come now with the sense of having the advantage, and with animosity prompting her to use it.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.183645,-2.5292144,56
11017,"Indeed, not Rosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case, and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have wondered why she came.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.205467,-2.9004476,31
11018,"Looking like the lovely ghost of herself, her graceful slimness wrapped in her soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three yards’ distance from her visitor and bowed.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.54571,0.96071553,38

11020,"Rosamond could not avoid meeting her glance, could not avoid putting her small hand into Dorothea’s, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately a doubt of her own prepossessions began to stir within her.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.185263,-2.9105875,35
11021,"Rosamond’s eye was quick for faces; she saw that Mrs. Casaubon’s face looked pale and changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of her hand.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.356664,-0.3697379,28
11022,"But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her own strength: the clearness and intensity of her mental action this morning were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her frame as dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in looking at Rosamond, she suddenly found her heart swelling, and was unable to speak—all her effort was required to keep back tears.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.322465,-2.9083352,67
11023,"She succeeded in that, and the emotion only passed over her face like the spirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond’s impression that Mrs. Casaubon’s state of mind must be something quite different from what she had imagined.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.444011,-0.32311878,40
11024,"So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that happened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though Rosamond’s notion when she first bowed was that she should stay a long way off from Mrs. Casaubon.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.947657,1.1213051,44
11025,But she ceased thinking how anything would turn out—merely wondering what would come.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.295696,1.2596633,13

11031,"You will let me speak of this without thinking that I take a liberty?”  The cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond’s mind as grounds of obstruction and hatred between her and this woman, came as soothingly as a warm stream over her shrinking fears.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.6025867,1.1143554,56
11032,"Of course Mrs. Casaubon had the facts in her mind, but she was not going to speak of anything connected with them.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.431447,-0.27049807,22

11035,"I shall like to hear anything you will say to me about Tertius.”  “The day before yesterday,” said Dorothea, “when I had asked him to come to Lowick to give me his opinion on the affairs of the Hospital, he told me everything about his conduct and feelings in this sad event which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.471252,0.3864748,61
11036,The reason he told me was because I was very bold and asked him.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.755784,4.209054,14

11039,"The truth is, he knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad secrets about him; and he thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him the money because he repented, out of kindness, of having refused it before.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,4.917122,4.7187057,40
11040,"All his anxiety about his patient was to treat him rightly, and he was a little uncomfortable that the case did not end as he had expected; but he thought then and still thinks that there may have been no wrong in it on any one’s part.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,7.8473988,2.8678353,47

11042,"That will cheer you, will it not?",CHAPTER LXXXI.,9.133963,5.678906,7
11043,"That will give you courage?”  Dorothea’s face had become animated, and as it beamed on Rosamond very close to her, she felt something like bashful timidity before a superior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.442632,-3.017682,36
11044,"She said, with blushing embarrassment, “Thank you: you are very kind.”  “And he felt that he had been so wrong not to pour out everything about this to you.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.38578,3.631034,29
11045,But you will forgive him.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.417747,4.233742,5

11047,He could speak to me because I am an indifferent person.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.955041,3.8219042,11

11050,"Trouble is so hard to bear, is it not?— How can we live and think that any one has trouble—piercing trouble—and we could help them, and never try?”  Dorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that she was uttering, forgot everything but that she was speaking from out the heart of her own trial to Rosamond’s.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.732352,-3.3425446,55
11051,"The emotion had wrought itself more and more into her utterance, till the tones might have gone to one’s very marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,9.720169,1.5105613,32

11053,"Rosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within her had been probed, burst into hysterical crying as she had done the day before when she clung to her husband.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.80584,1.1587367,31
11054,Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave of her own sorrow returning over her—her thought being drawn to the possible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond’s mental tumult.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,7.893339,-2.8017137,30
11055,"She was beginning to fear that she should not be able to suppress herself enough to the end of this meeting, and while her hand was still resting on Rosamond’s lap, though the hand underneath it was withdrawn, she was struggling against her own rising sobs.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.7896557,1.1652954,46
11056,"She tried to master herself with the thought that this might be a turning-point in three lives—not in her own; no, there the irrevocable had happened, but—in those three lives which were touching hers with the solemn neighborhood of danger and distress.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.261815,1.2873405,42
11057,The fragile creature who was crying close to her—there might still be time to rescue her from the misery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any other: she and Rosamond could never be together again with the same thrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.8368707,1.1551825,48
11058,"She felt the relation between them to be peculiar enough to give her a peculiar influence, though she had no conception that the way in which her own feelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,4.9102306,1.3245336,37
11059,"It was a newer crisis in Rosamond’s experience than even Dorothea could imagine: she was under the first great shock that had shattered her dream-world in which she had been easily confident of herself and critical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of feeling in a woman whom she had approached with a shrinking aversion and dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards her, made her soul totter all the more with a sense that she had been walking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.22976,-2.9488428,95
11060,"When Rosamond’s convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and she withdrew the handkerchief with which she had been hiding her face, her eyes met Dorothea’s as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.326048,-2.9099574,34
11061,What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying?,CHAPTER LXXXI.,9.693575,1.6969389,11
11062,"And Dorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a silent tear.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.7481785,-3.299319,14

11067,"He said he had been feeling very lonely in his trial; but I think he would have borne it all better if he had been able to be quite open with you.”  “Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything,” said Rosamond, imagining that he had been complaining of her to Dorothea.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.4492874,0.4385114,54
11068,"“He ought not to wonder that I object to speak to him on painful subjects.”  “It was himself he blamed for not speaking,” said Dorothea.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,9.031696,-3.502166,25
11069,"“What he said of you was, that he could not be happy in doing anything which made you unhappy—that his marriage was of course a bond which must affect his choice about everything; and for that reason he refused my proposal that he should keep his position at the Hospital, because that would bind him to stay in Middlemarch, and he would not undertake to do anything which would be painful to you.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,9.804438,3.6753857,73
11070,"He could say that to me, because he knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my husband’s illness, which hindered his plans and saddened him; and he knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting another who is tied to us.”  Dorothea waited a little; she had discerned a faint pleasure stealing over Rosamond’s face.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.647673,-3.423594,66

11073,"Even if we loved some one else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no use”—poor Dorothea, in her palpitating anxiety, could only seize her language brokenly—“I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving or getting any blessedness in that sort of love.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.543483,-3.4538,48
11074,I know it may be very dear—but it murders our marriage—and then the marriage stays with us like a murder—and everything else is gone.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.086834,2.9084613,24
11075,"And then our husband—if he loved and trusted us, and we have not helped him, but made a curse in his life—”  Her voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her of presuming too far, and of speaking as if she herself were perfection addressing error.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,10.446833,1.9122175,49
11076,"She was too much preoccupied with her own anxiety, to be aware that Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express pitying fellowship rather than rebuke, she put her hands on Rosamond’s, and said with more agitated rapidity,—“I know, I know that the feeling may be very dear—it has taken hold of us unawares—it is so hard, it may seem like death to part with it—and we are weak—I am weak—”  The waves of her own sorrow, from out of which she was struggling to save another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.264603,-2.9986613,96

11079,"Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful, undefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her lips to Dorothea’s forehead which was very near her, and then for a minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a shipwreck.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.209641,-2.9104164,61
11080,"“You are thinking what is not true,” said Rosamond, in an eager half-whisper, while she was still feeling Dorothea’s arms round her—urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something that oppressed her as if it were blood guiltiness.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.5545225,-3.2432153,40

11096,The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy.,CHAPTER LXXXI.,8.698076,-3.2844136,13

11098,"Her immediate consciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she cared for Rosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her last words—  “No, he cannot reproach you any more.”  With her usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she felt a great outgoing of her heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort which had redeemed her from suffering, not counting that the effort was a reflex of her own energy.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.644931,1.1285441,73

11121,"I have always been accused of being immoderate and saying too much.”  She put out her hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet good-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between them too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it superficially.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.647621,1.0924265,51

11125,"If you go to talk to her so often, you will be more discontented with me than ever!”  Lydgate laughed at the “so often.” “But has she made you any less discontented with me?”  “I think she has,” said Rosamond, looking up in his face.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,5.4174757,1.1814154,45
11126,"“How heavy your eyes are, Tertius—and do push your hair back.” He lifted up his large white hand to obey her, and felt thankful for this little mark of interest in him.",CHAPTER LXXXI.,6.4838505,0.5771262,32

11133,"When Will Ladislaw exiled himself from Middlemarch he had placed no stronger obstacle to his return than his own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind, and to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite facility.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,5.738099,-0.1054361,57
11134,"As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult to him to say why he should not run down to Middlemarch—merely for the sake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit he should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her, there was no reason for him to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey which he had beforehand supposed that he should not take.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.241439,-3.3031578,75
11135,"Since he was hopelessly divided from her, he might surely venture into her neighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch over her—their opinions seemed less and less important with time and change of air.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,10.908708,2.1036074,39
11136,"And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.170098,-3.1162217,23
11137,"Will had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a new plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out a good design had set him on debating with himself whether it would not be a laudable use to make of his claim on Bulstrode, to urge the application of that money which had been offered to himself as a means of carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,4.810347,3.9170542,79
11138,"The question seemed a very dubious one to Will, and his repugnance to again entering into any relation with the banker might have made him dismiss it quickly, if there had not arisen in his imagination the probability that his judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to Middlemarch.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,6.967596,3.2914543,51
11139,That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming down.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.539991,2.1755865,15
11140,"He had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money question with him, and he had meant to amuse himself for the few evenings of his stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with fair Rosamond, without neglecting his friends at Lowick Parsonage:—if the Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of his.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,5.705886,1.5671346,60
11141,"He had neglected the Farebrothers before his departure, from a proud resistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews with Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for the vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.501765,-3.057854,46
11142,"Nothing had done instead—not the opera, or the converse of zealous politicians, or the flattering reception (in dim corners) of his new hand in leading articles.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,7.620321,2.477944,26
11143,"Thus he had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there would be no surprises in his visit.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,7.962534,2.5409672,29
11144,"But he had found that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.182006,2.4064121,37
11145,"The next morning he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences—he dreaded so much the immediate issues before him—that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that he might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,7.2463574,2.131273,60
11146,"Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow absoluteness of men’s judgments.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,5.7602835,-0.09586329,25
11147,"He had found Lydgate, for whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,4.8344994,2.1683679,60
11148,"To a creature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral region of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,6.805259,1.235862,57
11149,"He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,10.065728,1.9011399,41
11150,And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on crutches.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,7.9602118,2.4487524,33
11151,"In the night he had debated whether he should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,4.998771,2.0891044,34
11152,"But there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.602282,-3.3840082,60
11153,Thus he did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,6.7440777,2.1691122,11

11157,"But it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to witness the saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue that may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.51812,3.0589995,35
11158,"If Dorothea, after her night’s anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond—why, she perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for discretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those three who were on one hearth in Lydgate’s house at half-past seven that evening.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.165303,-2.7993982,52
11159,"Rosamond had been prepared for Will’s visit, and she received him with a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her nervous exhaustion, of which he could not suppose that it had any relation to Will.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,5.548186,1.0839013,36
11160,"And when she sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he innocently apologized for her in an indirect way by begging her to lean backward and rest.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,10.509679,1.9710603,29
11161,"Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the part of a friend who was making his first appearance and greeting to Rosamond, while his thoughts were busy about her feeling since that scene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both, like the painful vision of a double madness.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.907962,1.7321697,52
11162,"It happened that nothing called Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea, and Will came near to fetch it, she placed a tiny bit of folded paper in his saucer.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,5.3574257,1.1594726,35
11163,"He saw it and secured it quickly, but as he went back to his inn he had no eagerness to unfold the paper.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.636389,1.6700016,23
11164,What Rosamond had written to him would probably deepen the painful impressions of the evening.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,6.7433114,1.3512404,15
11165,"Still, he opened and read it by his bed-candle.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.828036,1.5285238,9
11166,There were only these few words in her neatly flowing hand:—  “I have told Mrs. Casaubon.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.379421,-0.3456425,16
11167,She is not under any mistake about you.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,10.964919,2.5800736,8

11170,I shall not have made any difference to you.”  The effect of these words was not quite all gladness.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,9.160611,2.313327,19
11171,"As Will dwelt on them with excited imagination, he felt his cheeks and ears burning at the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond—at the uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her dignity wounded in having an explanation of his conduct offered to her.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.201555,-3.0415578,47
11172,There might still remain in her mind a changed association with him which made an irremediable difference—a lasting flaw.,CHAPTER LXXXII.,10.81737,1.8589548,19

11174,"Until that wretched yesterday—except the moment of vexation long ago in the very same room and in the very same presence—all their vision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart, where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and no other soul entered.",CHAPTER LXXXII.,8.734102,1.8646914,53

11178,"On the second morning after Dorothea’s visit to Rosamond, she had had two nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue, but felt as if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to say, more strength than she could manage to concentrate on any occupation.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.422415,-3.043578,52
11179,"The day before, she had taken long walks outside the grounds, and had paid two visits to the Parsonage; but she never in her life told any one the reason why she spent her time in that fruitless manner, and this morning she was rather angry with herself for her childish restlessness.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.020832,1.4580837,52

11185,"But there were various subjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she resolved to throw herself energetically into the gravest of all.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.6435,-3.2197108,25
11186,"She sat down in the library before her particular little heap of books on political economy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s neighbors, or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most good.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.177195,1.6371901,56

11189,This was hopeless.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.621406,4.9988236,3
11190,Should she order the carriage and drive to Tipton?,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.110087,0.20852731,9
11191,No; for some reason or other she preferred staying at Lowick.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.499756,-0.09383544,11
11192,But her vagrant mind must be reduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked round and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre she could arrest her wandering thoughts.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.96937,1.2190021,36
11193,Perhaps a mere task was the best means—something to which she must go doggedly.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.307466,1.4272594,14

11197,"Dorothea set earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the names in an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.916149,-3.1284862,25
11198,"She looked amusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and marking the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip, and now and then breaking off to put her hands on each side of her face and say, “Oh dear!",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.637053,1.4406469,46
11199,oh dear!”  There was no reason why this should end any more than a merry-go-round; but it was at last interrupted by the opening of the door and the announcement of Miss Noble.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,7.3824387,0.98095906,33
11200,"The little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea’s shoulder, was warmly welcomed, but while her hand was being pressed she made many of her beaver-like noises, as if she had something difficult to say.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.037947,-2.9123564,35
11201,"“Do sit down,” said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.954016,-2.9740593,9

11213,“Pray tell him to come.”  What else was there to be done?,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.129051,3.739014,12
11214,There was nothing that she longed for at that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him had thrust itself insistently between her and every other object; and yet she had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her—a sense that she was doing something daringly defiant for his sake.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.148342,1.469138,52
11215,"When the little lady had trotted away on her mission, Dorothea stood in the middle of the library with her hands falling clasped before her, making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified unconsciousness.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.867006,-3.0965474,37

11219,"“If I love him too much it is because he has been used so ill:”—there was a voice within her saying this to some imagined audience in the library, when the door was opened, and she saw Will before her.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,9.579638,2.8411977,40
11220,"She did not move, and he came towards her with more doubt and timidity in his face than she had ever seen before.",CHAPTER LXXXIII.,10.529452,1.9554121,23
11221,He was in a state of uncertainty which made him afraid lest some look or word of his should condemn him to a new distance from her; and Dorothea was afraid of her own emotion.,CHAPTER LXXXIII.,8.637839,-3.4231515,35

11615,"But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of the former, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, “The more spooneys they!” and immediately appealed to his mother whether boys were not better than girls.",FINALE.,11.378955,4.0911627,35

11618,"Fred never became rich—his hopefulness had not led him to expect that; but he gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his hands carried him in plenty through those “bad times” which are always present with farmers.",FINALE.,6.880753,5.4496784,52
11619,"Mary, in her matronly days, became as solid in figure as her mother; but, unlike her, gave the boys little formal teaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well grounded in grammar and geography.",FINALE.,11.826222,4.1205773,39
